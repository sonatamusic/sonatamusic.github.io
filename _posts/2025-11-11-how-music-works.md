## What Music REALLY Is, Who Makes It, Where, When, Why

Information is not knowledge. Knowledge is not wisdom. Wisdom is not truth. Truth is not beauty. Beauty is not love. Love is not music. Music is the best. —FRANK ZAPPA

### 1.0.1

## PIQUING THE POLARIZED

Chapter 1 addresses these five basic questions about music:

1. WHAT is music?
2. WHO makes music?
3. WHERE does music come from?
4. WHEN did music get started?
5. WHY is there such a thing as music?

The other question, "HOW does one go about creating music worth listening to?" takes nine chapters to answer-Chapters 3 through 11, the main part of the book.

Tackling the five "Ws" of the phenomenon of music necessitates delving into Darwinian natural selection and sexual selection. If you have a strong religious faith,

you may find bits of Chapter 1 offensive because of all the evolution stuff. On the other hand, if you have a strong atheistic belief, Chapter 1 may offend you, too, because it does not advocate for atheism.

If you already know all about natural selection and sexual selection and brain modularity, then Chapter 1 might simply bore you. If so, why not grab a bag of chips and ride on ahead to Chapter 2, which discusses the rise of the Western popular music industry and its various genres. Or Chapters 3 through 11, the sections on how to create memorable, emotionally powerful music and lyrics.

# 1.1  
What Is Music?

### 1.1.1

## BIOLOGICAL, NOT MYSTICAL

Music has played a central role in human existence for hundreds of thousands of years.

So...what is music? According to the evidence, it's probably an adaptation-although some researchers argue music is a byproduct of other adaptations.

What's an adaptation? It's a biological trait that evolved to promote survival or reproductive success. A tiger's fangs. A peacock's fan. A mosquito's ability to draw blood and escape into the night, just as you're trying to get to sleep.

As a human, you possess many formidable adaptations, such as bipedalism (twolegged walking), language, and a lot of other inborn skills that your fellow primates do not have. (Unlike horses, all primates - several hundred species-have highly flexible 5 -fingered hands, opposable digits, and sharp eyesight. Some, such as monkeys, apes, and humans, also have relatively large brains.)

Before biologists confer "adaptation" status upon a human trait, in a solemn ceremony at Stonehenge under a full moon, said trait must fulfil several criteria, among them:

- Humans in all present-day cultures must use the adaptation.
    
- Evidence from history and anthropology must indicate the adaptation's existence in ancient cultures.
    
- Evidence from palaeontology must indicate the adaptation's existence to some degree in extinct hominid species-that is, in other species of bipedal human-like primates, all now extinct.
    

All of the above apply to language and bipedalism. They also apply to music. Every human culture ever known has had music. Even societies that do not have well-developed visual arts show sophisticated musical development.

Today, practically all normal adult human beings:

- Can and do sing to some degree (Pop Idol/American Idol contestants notwithstanding), even if only in the privacy of an elevator or on the back of a horse in the hills south of Tulsa.
- Can and do tap at least one foot to a tune, once in a while (an important qualification as you'll see in a minute).
- Listen to self-chosen music, purchase music, and otherwise show appreciation for music at some level. ("I could've played guitar like Jimi, but I chose to go into accounting instead, to meet more women.")

# 1.2  
Who Makes Music?

1.2.1

## Hootin' and Howlin': How Animal Sounds DiffeR From Other Sounds In Nature

In nature, when you listen to the wind in the trees or water rushing in a stream, what do you hear? Random and diffuse background sound. Like traffic in the city. A wide range of frequencies all mixed together. (Frequency just means number of vibrations per second. A given frequency number corresponds to a particular tone or note, such as A-440, the A above Middle C. More on this in Chapter 3.)

Animals evolved ways of signalling each other using calls that focus on narrow bands of frequencies. Energy concentrated in this way results in sounds that carry long distances. You can hear the hootin' and howlin' easily against the random background sound.

Species also evolve sounds specific to their own kind, so that they can identify each other. In a tropical rainforest, for example, a small area of, say, one square kilometre may contain scores of different bird species. Each species has evolved a signature sound, a distinctive song or repertoire of songs. (More on developing a signature sound in Chapter 11.)

# 1.2.2

## HOOTIN' AND HOWLIN': INSTINCTIVE VS LEARNED

Studying vocalizations of non-human animals provides some clues about how music originated in humans. For instance, some animals use vocalizations to signal alarm, some to signal discovery of a food source.

All birds with complex songs learn their songs from each other. But they don't learn just any old tunes-they learn species-specific songs only. And, once learned, their songs change little. The fact that they learn songs at all, though, makes birds musically akin to humans, whales, and dolphins. (But that does not mean humans became musical by imitating birds!)

Oddly, some of our closest primate relatives, monkeys and chimpanzees, do not learn their vocalizations from each other. They're born with an instinctive and limited repertoire of grunts and calls. Chimpanzees have about 30 calls. Even the charming vocal duetting of gibbons is not learned; it's innate.

Animal calls and songs normally communicate an emotional state. So it's possible that the musical vocalizations that humans evolved did not co-evolve with language, since language communicates mostly information. Human music may have predated human language, but it's highly unlikely that language evolved before music.

### 1.2.3

## Human SOUNDMAKING: DISCRETE PITCHES (NO MORE HOOTIN' AND HOWLIN')

Non-human primate vocalization takes the form of unpitched grunts and calls, rather than discrete pitches. Your human brain does not respond happily to continuously

sliding hootin' and howlin' when presented in musical or speech contexts. It gets confused.

Unlike all other animals, humans evolved a vocal communication system that uses mainly discrete pitches. You can hear it in both speech and music. That's why the melodies of songs found in all musical traditions follow scales, groups of discrete pitches (the subject of Chapter 4).

# 1.2.4

## Human SOUNDMAKING: ENTRAINMENT (THAT'S EN-TRAIN-MENT, NOT ENTERTAINMENT)

Humans entrain to isometric beats.

- To entrain (from the same root as "train," referring to being dragged or carried along) means to join in and synchronize to a rhythmic source outside the body-to play, clap, tap, sing along. Or, as a musician would put it, to lock in with the band.
- Isometric refers to steady, evenly-spaced regular beats.

The ability to entrain rhythmically to an external beat-vital in both music and dance-has evolved only in humans. No other animal can do it. Selective pressure for teamwork and group coordination may have triggered the evolution of the rhythmic entrainment function in humans. (Selective pressure refers to the environmental demands-including conditions in the social environment-that favour the Darwinian evolution of physical and mental traits over a long period of time. In short, selective pressure drives Darwinian evolution. For example, selective pressure for group bonding may have driven, among many other social behaviours, the evolution of the human ability to harmonize, or blend discrete pitches-a skill unique to humans.)

The innate ability to entrain means people can participate in a musical performance without knowing how to play a musical instrument-clapping along, nodding to the beat, and, of course, dancing. A few animals can chorus in synchrony, such as frogs and crickets. But only humans can vary the tempo (number of beats per minute) from slow to several times faster, without losing the sense of synchronous timing.

Only humans have the ability to play musical instruments. Non-human primates cannot keep a steady beat or learn new melodic sequencing. That's why they're incapable of playing the most basic of instruments, and cannot be trained to learn even the simplest human music (although they can learn simple human language).

Every human culture ever known has had music. We humans take for granted our effortless discrete-pitch vocalizing and isometric time-keeping skills. Non-human animals have no such abilities, and consequently no true appreciation of bluegrass, ABBA, or hip-hop. Except for certain breeds of dogs who join in when they hear particular songs from musical theatre and R& BR& B.

## Where Does Music Come From?

### 1.3.1  
Not Out of Thin Air: Music Comes from EvOLVED BRAIN "MODULES"

Some people believe music comes wafting magically out of thin air in the form of mysterious, disembodied "inspiration." It then presumably lodges in the skull of the composer or songwriter, who feverishly jots it down or records it on a tiny digital device, and later claims, "It just came to me in a flash. I wrote the whole song in 23 seconds."

That's where music seems to come from. But the musical inspiration you enjoy actually comes to you courtesy of the parallel processing that goes on in certain integrated "modules" within the fascinating neuro-computational organ located inside your head.

Your brain processes music and also creates music. So, what's a module? It's a network of brain cells, a brain structure, that has evolved to carry out some specialized function. The Canadian cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker, in How the Mind Works, describes the mind as "what the brain does," or, more specifically, ...not a single organ but a system of organs, which we can think of as psychological faculties or mental modules.

Evidence from cognitive science, neuroscience, evolutionary biology, evolutionary psychology, and other disciplines points to the existence of numerous such brain structures. Possibly hundreds of them. A mental toolbox that enables you to survive and replicate your genes in your offspring.

Consider your body's architecture. You have many physical body parts, external and internal-hands, feet, lungs, heart, etc. You can easily identify numerous subparts as well: each of your hands has fingers, fingernails, knuckles, a thumb, palm, muscles, ligaments. Every normal human is born with these physical internal and external body parts.

The same applies to your brain's architecture. Even though you can't see your brain's modules, they're as real, and as different from each other, as your hands and your liver. And, like the rest of your body parts, you have these brain structures at birth.

All other humans on the planet are born with the same brain modules as you, just as they're born with the same internal and external body parts that make all of us identifiably human. And that means, as discussed later in this chapter, humans show remarkable similarities in behaviour in every culture globally.

Brain modules or faculties vary slightly from individual to individual, just as other body parts do. The feet you were born with, for example, have the same basic structure and anatomy as everybody else's feet. While easily identifiable as "feet," your feet vary slightly from everyone else's; they're identifiably yours.

Same with the mental faculties or modules you were born with. While each one performs the same specialized function in every human brain, your modules vary slightly from everyone else's. But, like your feet, your mental modules still perform in a recognizably human way. That's why human culture shows so much similarity everywhere in the world. And that includes musical similarity, discussed in more detail later in this chapter.

# MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCES

What exactly is intelligence? Usually, it's defined as the ability to understand, reason, and solve problems. So IQ tests focus on logical and verbal abilities.

However, according to the theory of multiple intelligences (controversial, but nonetheless intriguing because it jibes with evidence that the mind has evolved as a complex modular systemi, humans have other kinds of intelligence-interpersonal intelligence, kinesthetic intelligence, visual intelligence, and so on. One of these is musical intelligence.

Most people excel at only one or two kinds of intelligence. For instance, if you're gifted as a musician, and also have an outstanding ability to empathize, then you might have

exceptional potential for writing songs-and yet score only average on a standard IQ test.

# 1.3.2  
You Were Born With a PersonalitY

The genetic code to build a head full of specialized modules evolved in response to selective pressure over millions of years. Being born with music-acquisition, language-acquisition and other skills and abilities already wired in your brain means you were born with a basic personality. You inherited it from your parents. But the personality you had at birth differed substantially from the personalities of your parents.

Your modular brain structures are not completely developed, connected, and constructed at birth. That's why it takes some time before you can talk and sing.

The same applies to other aspects of your development. It takes several years before your permanent teeth come in. If you're female, you don't begin to develop breasts until puberty. If you're male, you don't grow facial hair until then. Nevertheless, at birth, you have the brain wiring in place for all this to happen.

From childhood on, the surrounding culture shapes the personality you were born with, but does not replace it. The personality you have today owes its character partly to your genetic inheritance (perhaps half), and partly to your personal environment (perhaps half)-especially your peer group. (NOTE: This does not mean that your genetic inheritance causes 50%50% of your personality and your peer group causes the other 50%50%. Instead, it refers to observed variance in measures of personality and behaviour due to diversity among individuals in all kinds of areas related to upbringing, such as education, religion, leisure activities, and so on.)

Genetic inheritance influences everyone's behaviour today, as it always has. That is, no matter how "enculturated" we humans think we've become, we have not by any means "outgrown our genes"!

### 1.3.3

## Modules Ain't COMPUTERS

At birth, your brain came equipped with numerous pre-wired adaptations-precisely the opposite of a "blank slate" (more on this a bit later). Your brain does not function like a "general-purpose computer" with a single processor. As an example of the

inborn modular nature of the brain, consider the brain circuitry for modelling objects visually. It exists in the brains of all people at birth-even people born blind. That is, some people blind from birth can accurately draw objects in proper 3-D visual perspective, a skill they could not possibly learn from the surrounding culture. For example, a Turkish artist named Esref Armagan, who has been blind since birth, can paint realistic compositions of things he has never seen, with accurate three-point perspective and scale size.

Your brain's modular architecture does not resemble conventional computer design. Pinker again:

The word 'module' brings to mind detachable snap-in components, and that is misleading. Mental modules are not likely to be visible to the naked eye as circumscribed territories on the surface of the brain, like the flank steak and rump roast on the supermarket cow display. A mental module probably looks more like roadkill, sprawling messily over the bulges and crevasses of the brain. Or it may be broken into regions that are interconnected by fibers that make the regions act as a unit...the metaphor of the mental module is a bit clumsy; a better one is Noam Chomsky's 'mental organ.'

If you own an ordinary desktop or notebook computer, it's a serial computer that mimics a parallel computer. Unlike your brain, a computer processor executes only one instruction at a time. But it does its work so fast that it usually fools you into thinking it's doing several things at once.

That's not how your brain works. Brain structures tend to evolve as specializations for various tasks, such as detecting danger, recognizing faces, protecting kin, mating, predicting the behaviour of others, and playing the harmonica for your horse.

Taken together, your brain's constituent modules do not function like a conventional computer. Nor like computer software. Nor like a mechanical clock. Rather, they connect up in vastly complex networks of neurons that communicate with each other and vie for your attention. Your brain is a massively parallel neural organ of computation, not a serial one. That is, unlike a small conventional humanmade computer, your small conventional human brain processes information and interpretations using many different modules simultaneously. That's why you can drive your car, drink coffee, talk on your cell phone, and run over a pedestrian, all at the same time. Try programming a computer to do that!

# 1.3.4

## EVIDENCE FOR BRAIN MODULARITY

Where does the evidence of brain modularity come from?

Studies of patients who have experienced brain lesions (structural changes in the brain) due to injury or disease reveal brain modularity. Many patients exhibit the same behavioural changes or deficits after suffering a brain lesion that occurs in the same physical area of the brain, often due to a stroke. Observations of the effects of injuries and diseases occurring in different parts of the brain have disclosed a number of modules.

Another source is measurement and observation of brain activity using positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). These techniques reveal which specific parts of the brain are active during the performance of a mental or physical task. If, in many individuals, the same specific areas "light up" during the performance of the same task, it indicates a module or modules at work.

Some other information sources that scientists in a variety of specialties use to investigate the functioning of the brain's mental organs are:

- Observed effects of abnormalities in specific genes that implicate certain modules, such as the FOXP2 gene and language (discussed a bit later in this section)
- Observed effects of taking drugs that act on specific modules
- Optical and aural illusions that trigger conflicts between modules
- Studies of behaviour and abilities of newborns and pre-lingual infantsparticularly useful in revealing the inborn, adaptive aspects of music
- Comparative studies of identical twins, fraternal twins, biological siblings, and adopted siblings
- Human behaviour studies that control for cultural variables (psychological experimentation)
- Findings from palaeontology-e.g., discovery of a 44,000-year-old bone flute at a Neanderthal site, indicating they had similar mental functioning in music as humans
- Findings from archaeology
- Studies of behaviour and learning in animals, especially our close primate cousins such as chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, gibbons
- Genome data-e. g., chimpanzees, bonobos, and humans share more than 98%98% of the same genetic material

The human brain took millions of years to evolve into an incredibly complex, powerful thing of beauty. Dissecting a cadaver's brain provides no information about the workings of the living, functioning brain. And neurosurgeons cannot open up skulls of living humans simply to poke, prod, and probe through all the billions of tangled microscopic neurons, to see how everything works. So evolutionary psychologists and biologists can and do use data from the sources listed above to, in effect, reverse engineer the brain as best they can.

# MYTH OF 10% USE OF THE BRAIN

Perhaps the source of this myth is that, at any given moment, you only use a fraction of your entire brain. But throughout the day, you do use all of it.

If you're sitting down, you don't need to use the modules required to get you walking or running. If you're in a quiet room reading a book, you don't need to use your music-processing modules.

Your brain functions pretty efficiently. So you don't require the use of every module in your brain at every moment. Think of driving a car. You don't use your car's accelerator at every moment, nor the brakes, horn, radio, signal lights isome drivers never use themti, and so on.

You don't use all of your brain all of the time, but you certainly do need all of the modules in your brain. You do use all of them. Otherwise, they would not have evolved in the first place.

Brain modules are adaptations-necessary units of biological function-that evolve in response to selective pressure.

### 1.3.5

## Where in the Brain? Music Modules in INFANTS

If music were not a true adaptation, it would have had to have arisen only recently. However, the evidence indicates music probably predates our own species, Homo sapiens. That is, other hominid species, now extinct, such as Homo neanderthalensis, had music.

As well, neurological evidence supports the hypothesis that modules for creating and processing music exist in the brain at birth.

Setting aside lyrics for the moment and considering music only, most people think of the melody-the tune-as the essence of a piece of music.

- Harmony without melody or rhythm just doesn't work.
- Rhythm without melody or harmony gets tiresome after a while due to something called habituation (discussed in later chapters).
- But you can create palatable music with melody only-no harmony or regular beat (e. g., background music in film and television).

Infants perceive melodic patterns much as adults do. They respond to changes in melodic contour and changes in key like adults do, indicating genetic origins. Newborns have pre-wired neuronal circuitry to perceive the following (if you're not familiar with some of the musical terminology below, all will be revealed in the next few chapters):

- Melodic contour in both music and speech
- Consonant intervals (Chapter 4 goes into detail about intervals)
- Rhythmic patterns in both music and speech

Pre-lingual infants in all cultures can:

- Recognize changes in a melody
- Resolve tiny pitch differences (and small timing differences)
- Recognize the same melody even if sped up or slowed down
- Recognize the same melody when transposed to a different key
- Perceive diatonic tunes more easily than non-diatonic tunes
- Perceive consonant intervals more easily than dissonant intervals
- Respond to their mothers' melodious, song-like vocalizing to a much greater degree than their mothers' speech vocalizing
- Adapt to the musical conventions of whatever society they're born into

Culture modifies the expression of these predispositions, but the predispositions exist in the brain at birth (characteristic of adaptations).

Babies worldwide spontaneously initiate musical sound-play. Young children are forever inventing games and rhythmic play. Adults do not teach them this stuff. In fact, children have difficulty separating rhythmic body movements from music and singing until age four or five. Next time you observe a preschooler having a musical experience, notice how he or she jumps around, claps and makes other rhythmic gestures.

# 1.3.6  
Where in the Brain? Modularity and Universal Musical Grammar

Music can best be understood as a system of relationships between tones, just as language is a system of relationships between words. -ANTHONY STORR

Groups of inter-connected modules for processing music probably developed independently over time. Separate sub-modules likely process tone duration, pitch, loudness, and timbre. Interestingly, lesion studies indicate that separate modules even process the closely-related elements, meter and rhythm.

Pitch patterns that group hierarchically (discussed in Chapter 8) appear to form the basis of musical syntax (set of musically "grammatical" rules).

Our brains have a genetically determined ability to create, learn, and process language, called "Universal Grammar," one of Noam Chomsky's seminal discoveries in linguistics. It appears that our brains also have a genetically determined specialization for music. Fred Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff, who coauthored a classic book on the subject, labelled it Universal Musical Grammar. They were inspired to a degree by the Polish music theorist Heinrich Schenker.

However, just as people learn a specific language in childhood and don't understand other languages without learning them, so people learn specific musical styles of their culture and don't understand the musical styles of other cultures without learning them.

On the other hand, musical universals bespeak the genetic underpinnings of all music (musical universals are listed a bit later). If you make music that breaks the brain's inborn rules, regardless of culture, the music you make will likely not appeal to more than a handful of humans.

If you play recordings of bird songs of different species to young songbirds raised in captivity, they will only learn the songs of their own species, evidence of genetic origins. Blackbirds in captivity, no matter how much loving care and patient training

they receive, stubbornly refuse to learn the Lennon-McCartney tune "Blackbird," because a blackbird did not write the song.

The same appears to apply to human infants. Human babies recognize and learn speech and melodies characteristic of the human species, rather than a particular culture. If you learn two languages in childhood, you'll learn both effortlessly and speak both without an accent as an adult. But if you learn one language in childhood and a second language as an adult, you will learn the first language effortlessly and speak it without an accent, and the second only with considerable effort, and speak it with an accent.

Since all of the world's musics share a set of universals, like languages, it's likely that this phenomenon applies to musical cultures. Suppose you have grown up learning the tonal system of the West, with little exposure to the tonal system of, say, India. And suppose, as an adult, you decide to move to India and learn to play the sitar. You'll probably find yourself expending considerable effort to learn what young Indian sitar players seem to learn effortlessly. And, after some years of training, you will likely play the instrument "with an accent," so to speak, compared with nativeborn players of your age and musical experience. (Try it!)

# 1.3.7

## WHERE IN THE BRAIN? LATERALIZATION IN ANIMALS AND HUMANS

Brain lateralization refers to the location of neuronal circuitry for specific skills and behaviours in either the left or the right hemisphere of the brain. Handedness reveals brain lateralization, or lack of it, in a clear way. In most species, handednessfavouring the right or left hand, hoof, wing, paw-is non-committal. For example, you'll find left- and right-handedness equally distributed in chimpanzees and other apes. A few animals other than humans have pronounced handedness, such as the walrus, of all creatures.

Humans manifest extremely specialized right-handedness, reflecting the importance of left-brain sequencing and left-brain language adaptations. Humans probably communicated symbolically with hand gestures before, and during the process of, converting to symbolic spoken language.

Brain lateralization in humans may have resulted from growing numbers and complexities of modular specializations competing for space as the brain swelled in size in response to selective pressure to cope with larger and more complex human social organization. Something related to the social nature of humans drove the huge expansion of the brain. It could well have been either music or language.

The left hemisphere tries to solve problems and processes sequential patterns, including language and rhythm. It's also active in positive emotional processing.

The right hemisphere has modules for, among other things, spatial cognition and the interpretation of harmony.

# WHY MOM HOLDS BABY ON THE LEFT

Why does Mom hold baby with baby's head on Mom's left side? It's not because of a connection the baby feels with Mom's heartbeat. And it also has nothing to do with right-handedness versus left-handedness. Left-handed mothers also tend to hold their babies on the left.

It has to do with brain specialization for emotional processing. As you know, the brain's right hemisphere connects to left body functions, and vice-versa. The right hemisphere is active in negative-emotion processing ifear, sadness). So the right hemisphere of Mom's brain land Dad's brain, tool, wired to her left field of vision and hearing, can more sensitively attune to her infant's negative emotional signals, enabling Mom to take action accordingly. Baby can't talk yet, so mother-child communication is necessarily completely emotional.

By the way, this is why, when you're talking to someone, you look at their right eye (your left field of vision), not their left eye.

The brain has roughly 10 billion neurons (nerve cells). Although women have smaller brains than men, women's brains have significantly more neurons per unit of cortex than men's brains (up to 12%12% more). And women's brains have a somewhat different organizational architecture than men's brains. In any case, sheer brain size doesn't seem to matter much in humans. Albert Einstein's brain weighed less than the average adult male brain.

The overall architecture of your brain mimics the architecture of the rest of your body: a mirror-image pair of everything on each side, but only one of the things in the middle. You have one corpus callosum, the main bundle of nerves (there are others) that connects the left and right hemispheres. If you're a woman, your corpus callosum is quite a bit larger than it is in the brain of a man. This may account for the superior ability of women to reconcile conflicting left-right brain analyses of situations.

The female brain is significantly less lateralized than the male brain. Functional modules are more globally distributed.

Female and male humans have different attitudes and behave differently because of differences in evolved brain functions, wired-in from birth (more on this later in the chapter). Apparently, this fact still stirs controversy.

# 1.3.8  
Where in THE BRAIN? LATERALIZATION AND MUSIC

The common belief that the right hemisphere processes music and the left processes language does not hold up.

If Doc Yada-Yadams, a fully qualified neurosurgeon, were to sedate the left hemisphere of your brain (don't try this at home), you would likely be able to sing a song (i.e., melody with words), but would not be able to speak. If the Doc sedated your right hemisphere, you would be able to speak, but not sing.

Language and music "time-share" many characteristics in both hemispheres. Singing tends to be more right-hemisphere, with speech more left-hemisphere. Both the left and right hemispheres appear to process pitch intervals.

Most people have a preferred listening ear, usually the right ear, which is connected to the speech-processing left hemisphere. When you answer the phone, you usually use your right ear.

In male musicians, music shows much more lateralized processing in the brain, compared with female musicians.

As for modularity, whether they're in the right, left, or both hemispheres, separate modules apparently process the time-based elements of music (meter, rhythm), compared with the melodic elements (pitch, intervals). No one knows exactly how many modules do the work.

Professional musicians show left-hemisphere dominance for music, amateurs right-hemisphere, probably because trained musicians approach music more analytically. As well, highly skilled musicians appear to use a significantly larger proportion of the brain in processing music than do people who listen to music but don't play.

In broad terms, the evidence on brain lateralization in music processing indicates the following (Table 1):

# TABLE 1 Brain Lateralization in Music Processing

## Left hemisphere (connected to right ear and right side of body) processes:

- Time-based elements of music irhythmi using sequenceprocessing modules
- Rhythmic aspects of melody
- Rapidly-changing information such as speech—sequences of words.

## Right hemisphere (connected to left ear and left side of body) processes:

- Pitch-based elements such as the shape of a melody (melodic contour) and tonal patterns
- Harmony; the right hemisphere is better at spatial cognition; in a sense, the right hemisphere processes pitch and harmony as "spatial" elements of sound
- The emotional tone of voice (via the left ear, which is connected to the right hemisphere) better than the left hemisphere

## Brain Lateralization and Music Mixing

Record producers and recording engineers, if they know what they're doing, take into account brain lateralization in producing a stereo mix:

- Rhythm-heavy tracks sound more natural ifbiassed a little to the right speaker (right ear; left brain hemisphere).
- Harmony-rich tracks sound better if biassed a little to the left speaker (left ear; right brain hemisphere).
- Tracks requiring both melodic and rhythmic processing, such as lead vocals (including rapping, which has a lot of melodic content), sound better in the middle.
- If lyric intelligibility is a problem, right-speaker bias may help, as the right ear is connected to the speech- and sequence-processing left hemisphere.

# 1.3.9

## WHERE IN THE BRAIN? AMUSIA

Some may say that I couldn't sing, but no one can say that I didn't sing -FLORENCE FOSTER JENKINS, arguably one of the world's worst singers Amusia is the scientific term for what most people call tone deafness and other "musical brain" disorders. It refers to any of several disorders that result in loss of ability to create music, or to perceive and understand music (or both).

Sometimes brain trauma causes amusia. Sometimes disease triggers it. Sometimes it's congenital. If you have congenital amusia, you're born without the normal brain wiring to process pitch and rhythm. Consequently you can't sing in tune or tap in time with a steady beat (you can't entrain). Amusia is not common; it is believed to affect only about 5%5% of the population. Florence Foster Jenkins may have had congenital amusia.

Stroke victims develop acquired or receptive amusia if they suffer brain damage to modules that process music. If you develop amusia this way, you can recognize the lyrics of a song you had known before you acquired amusia-but only when somebody speaks the lyrics to you. If they sing the lyrics, you can no longer recognize the tune. You have a hard time grasping or perceiving music. You can't follow a melody, identify the sounds of various musical instruments, or make sense of chords.

Expressive amusia refers to the inability to create music by singing in tune, or entrain to an external source of music by tapping in time. However, if you have expressive amusia, you can usually still enjoy and understand music, and even remember tunes.

### 1.3.10

## Where in the Brain? Modularity and UNIVERSAL LINGUISTIC GRAMMAR

The ability to acquire and use language is a species-specific human activity. -NOAM CHOMSKY Since this book deals with lyrics (Chapter 10) as well as music, it's fitting right about now to have a quick look at the whereabouts and identity of language in the brain.

In the 1950s, the American linguist Noam Chomsky proposed that language was located as a module or system of modules in the brain. Turns out he was right. His work was a turning point in the cognitive revolution and the downfall of behaviourism, the doctrine that humans have blank-slate brains at birth.

According to Chomsky, a generative grammar-a set of language rules-is encoded in the neuronal architecture of the brain, and is present at birth. Brain wiring for generative grammar makes it possible for young children to automatically become fluent in any language they are exposed to, effortlessly, and without the need for adult teaching. Literacy has nothing to do with language learning. Illiterate people worldwide have no difficulty communicating orally at the same grammatical level as those around them.

If you were born in Dodge City but raised from infancy in the Canadian Arctic, you would grow up speaking Inuktitut. If you were born an Inuit in the far north but raised from infancy in Dodge, you would speak English, grow luxuriant flowing hair, and sing Classic Western songs about lost love and horses. With a Kansas accent.

Unlike your vocabulary, you don't have to learn your "mental grammar," as it's called. You were born with it. That's why, long before you started school, you already knew the difference between, "Mommy plays the piano," and "The piano plays Mommy," even though both sentences use the same four words. Universal Grammar means your brain automatically rejects patterns such as these:

- Plays piano the Mommy
- Piano the Mommy plays
- The plays Mommy piano
- Piano Mommy plays the and so on. Your brain has evolved the miraculous capacity to automatically distinguish a "thing" (noun) from an "action" (verb) from a "qualifier" (adjective, adverb, determiner). So, even if you never go to school and learn so-called "proper grammar," you will speak in grammatically correct sentences, indistinguishable from the sentences spoken by others in your society who have had the benefit of a formal education. "Proper grammar" is built into your brain.

Chomsky's generative grammar theory has had an enormous impact in all of the cognitive sciences (i.e., sciences concerned with perception, intelligence, learning, and other aspects of mental function), not just the specialties relating to language. Scientists have since discovered many other modular adaptations throughout the brain.

Every language in the world has the same design features. That is, although languages seem to have completely different syntaxes (grammatical rules), close analysis shows that all languages share the same deep structure. For example, all languages have verbs and nouns and either a subject-object or object-subject order.

Since people of many cultures create languages independently, this means the capacity for acquiring and using language must have a genetic basis. Language appears to have its own neural architecture, or set of modules and sub-modules. These modules operate independently of other cognitive functions such as perception, reasoning, and knowledge-acquisition.

The brain has the innate capacity to easily store words and their meanings, as well as the rules or patterns that recognize word types and word orders (I. e., grammar). Our mental dictionary and our mental grammar, while independent, work together in the parallel-processing neural organ of computation that is the human brain.

Dramatic evidence supporting the theory that the ability to create language from scratch is pre-wired in the brain at birth comes from studies of two sign languages in widely separated populations of deaf people, one in Israel, the other in Nicaragua. In these two populations, people created new languages from scratch, languages that could not possibly have been transmitted culturally. Linguists discovered that both languages function by the same grammatical rules as languages worldwide. The only difference is the channel of transmission of meaning-via signing instead of speaking.

Although selective pressure drove evolution of the brain adaptation for spoken language, which all humans use today, the same does not apply to written language, which only some humans have. To acquire written language, you have to learn it, because it's a technological development, not an adaptation. (Written language emerged from idiographic representations of spoken language.)

# THE STROOP EFFECT: MODULES IN CONFLICT

Your brain's many modules are specialized to perform different tasks. The Stroop effect demonstrates how the information arising from the processing of different modules can cause interference.

Here are 25 words. Time yourself reading the words aloud, left to right, line by line, without errors: "grey, black, white," etc.

## GREY BLACK WHITE WHITE BLACK

## GREY BLACK GREY BLACK WHITE

BLACK GREY BLACK BLACK GREY WHITE WHITE GREY WHITE BLACK WHITE WHITE BLACK

Now time yourself reading the COLOR of each of the 25 words aloud, left to right, line by line. For example, the first three

words would be "black, white, grey." Not so easy this time-it takes considerably longer.

How come? The American psychologist John Ridley Stroop devised this test in the 1930s to demonstrate the interference effect your brain experiences when linguistic information conflicts with information from other senses.

When you ignore color and simply read the words, you only need to use your language processing system, so it's easy to say each word aloud. But when you try to say the color of each word, your brain's executive system discerns a conflict between what your color processing modules are telling you and what your language processing modules are telling you about the meanings of the words associated with the colors. Two different kinds of information are entangled.

To sort out the conflicting information, you have to first suppress the meaning of each word normally associated with the sequence of letters. This takes some effort. Then you have to translate the color of each group of letters into the word with the meaning that matches the color. Only then can you say the correct word.

Primates such as gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos do not develop any kind of language-like communication system in the wild. They lack the language brain modules that humans are born with. However, in captivity, with much time and effort, trainers can get them to understand, in a rudimentary way, that arbitrary symbols represent objects. Apes can also "learn" elementary grammar-like rules, such as linking two symbols representing something different from either of the individual symbols. With about 30 years of patient training, a great ape can memorize a couple of hundred word meanings, and can almost acquire the language understanding of an 18 -month-old human child. Bonobos fare somewhat better at "language learning" than chimpanzees.

## WHERE IN THE BRAIN? FOXP2 AND MYH16

In 1990, Steven Pinker hypothesized that language evolved in humans by conventional Darwinian natural selection (Section 1.5 discusses natural selection). Chomsky, who first described brain-based universal grammar, did not go that far.

Twelve years later, in 2002, a team of German and British geneticists published genetic evidence strongly supporting Pinker. They discovered that a particular gene, FOXP2, plays a vital role in processing speech and grammar.

FOXP2 exists in other primates such as the chimpanzee, but the human form of the gene differs. The human form may have appeared 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. Communication by language gradually replaced communication by gesture. Language was the breakthrough technology that resulted in symbolic thinking and the cultural explosion that defines what it is to be human.

If you happen to be born with abnormal human FOXP2, you will suffer from severe language impairment. That means that the normal human form is a naturally selected mutation, a "target of natural selection." (A mutation is a randomly occurring change in the gene, resulting in a change in physiology or anatomy or even behaviour.) And that strongly indicates that the innate human capacity for effortless language learning is an adaptation, the product of Darwinian natural selection.

About two million years ago, the hominid brain suddenly (in glacial evolutionary terms) began to get larger and larger, a process called encephalation. This did not occur in any of the other large primates, such as chimpanzees and gorillas. A mutation occurred in hominids around that time, a mutation that may have made encephalation possible.

A gene called MYH16, active in chimpanzees, ensures huge jaw muscle build-up, necessary for powerful chewing. These muscles constrict the skull, something like bungee cords, preventing growth in cranial capacity. In hominids, a mutation appeared line that deactivated MYH16. This may have freed the hominid skull to expand. And expand it did, tripling in size over the next 2 million years. To this day, chimpanzees still have the active version of MYH16 and comparatively small skulls. All humans have the deactivated human mutation of MYH16 and comparatively huge skulls.

As well, there's evidence of a connection between MYH16 and FOXP2. It turns out that if you have abnormal human FOXP2, you not only have grave cognitive language difficulties, but you also have physical problems with your mouth and jaw muscles.

Taken together, the uniquely human variants of MYH16 and FOXP2 look like smoking-gun mutations with respect to encephalation and language development.

# 1.3.12

## Where in THE BRAIN? APhASIA

Aphasia is the language equivalent of amusia, discussed a bit earlier. Aphasia refers to any of several disorders that result in loss of ability to communicate in speech or writing (or both). There are two main types:

1. Broca's Aphasia (also called expressive aphasia):

- If you have a stroke or otherwise suffer damage to a specific area of the left hemisphere called Broca's area, you will have difficulty speaking. However, the content of what you're saying, slow and disjointed as it may come out, will make sense.
- Interestingly, if you have Broca's aphasia, you will have great difficulty reciting or speaking the words of a song you had learned before developing aphasia, but will usually be able to sing the words fluently.

2. Wernicke's Aphasia (also called fluent aphasia):

- If you have a stroke or otherwise suffer damage to an area of the left hemisphere called Wernicke's area, you will be able to speak fluently, but the content of what you're saying will not make sense.
- Numerous politicians, some defence attorneys, Ann Coulter, television evangelists, many advertising copywriters, talk radio hosts, and talk radio callers appear to suffer from Wernicke's aphasia.

# 1.3.13  
The Combinatorial Nature of Music and LANGUAGE

Chomsky pointed out the following:

- Pretty much every sentence that everyone utters is a different combination of words, never heard before.
- That means it's impossible to store all sentences in the brain.
- That means the brain must have a mechanism for putting words together in a meaningful way.
- That means the brain can tell the difference between a group of words that makes sense, and a group of words that pickles without lamented occidental Custer's stapler.

Here's how Steven Pinker describes the combinatorial nature of the brain's language module:

A finite number of discrete elements (in this case, words) are sampled, combined, and permuted to create larger structures (in this case, sentences) with properties that are quite distinct from those of their elements. For example, the meaning of Man bites dog is different from the meaning of the same words combined in reverse order.

It's possible, therefore, to construct a practically infinite number of sentences with a relatively limited vocabulary.

The same applies to music:

- A scale has a finite number of different pitches.
- Each pitch can last for a finite number of different time values.
- Each pitch can be combined with a finite number of other pitches to create a finite number of intervals and chords. And so on.

Even though each type of musical property (melody, harmony, rhythm) has a finite number of elements, when you multiply out all the possibilities, you get a practically infinite number of possible tunes a songwriter could write. That's what combinatorial means.

- Chomsky's universal generative linguistic grammar describes the brain's ability to compile an inventory of words and apply a set of combinatorial rules.
- Lerdahl and Jackendoff's universal generative musical grammar describes the brain's ability to compile an inventory of tones and apply a set of combinatorial rules.

The whole human brain is a combinatorial system, a parallel-processing neural organ of computation. Using mentalese (described below), a discrete number of mental symbols can be combined and recombined, using as many modules and submodules as necessary. In other words, humans have the ability to think up, or imagine, an almost infinite number of possibilities, because thought is itself combinatorial. That's why behaviour is infinitely variable.

Both music and language use small numbers of elements to generate an infinite number of combinations of word phrases and musical phrases. Therefore, it's likely that the brain function of combinatoriality evolved before the evolution of separate music and language specialties.

# THE GENETIC CODE IS LIKE LANGUAGE

The genetic code, like language, is combinatorial. That's why every bacterium, plant and creature is genetically different, even within the same species, and even though each uses the same 64 three-letter DNA "words."

Here are some analogies between language and the genetic code:

|Language|Genetic Code|
|:-:|:-:|
|LETTERS  <br>26 letters (symbols), A, B, C, etc.|NUCLEOTIDES  <br>4 nucleotides: cytosine, guanine, adenine, and thymine|
|WORDS  <br>A word consists of one or more letters. Thousands of words are in a dictionary. Speech and written documents are comprised of words from the dictionary.|CODONS  <br>A codon consists of three adjacent nucleotides. 64 codons form the genetic dictionary. All living things use the same 64 -codon dictionary.|
|SENTENCES  <br>Sequences of words are called sentences or lines of poetry, etc. They code meaningful representations of thought.|GENES  <br>Sequences of codons-strands of DNA-are called genes. They code chains of amino acid molecules called proteins, which comprise various body parts.|
|CHAPTERS  <br>Many sentences form a larger unit called a chapter.|CHROMOSOMES  <br>Many genes form a long strand of DNA called a chromosome.|

|BOOK  <br>All of the chapters  <br>containing all of the  <br>sentences form a  <br>book—perhaps 10,000  <br>sentences.|GENOME  <br>All of the chromosomes,  <br>containing all of the genes,  <br>form the genome of the  <br>organism. Humans have 23  <br>pairs of chromosomes, one  <br>member of each pair from  <br>each parent. The human  <br>genome consists of some  <br>20,000 to 25,000 genes.|
|:--|:--|

The fact that all life on earth is based on the same 64-codon DNA dictionary makes it a virtual certainty that all life, all microbes, plants, and animals that have ever existed-dinosaurs, oysters, apple trees, sharks, daffodils, rats, chimpanzees, and humans-evolved from the same single molecular strand, a monad (first simple organism) that fused, through natural chemical mechanisms, from non-living molecules nearly 4 billion years ago.

# 1.3.14

## How Plastic Is Your Brain?

The human brain exhibits some degree of plasticity. For example, a young child who trains as a pianist experiences some modification in the cortex as a result of that musical training.

While your brain is in some measure, "adapted to adapt," plasticity does not mean your brain consists of a lot of generalized matter that can do pretty much anything. Plasticity simply means a module can take on some functioning for which it was not specifically adapted, provided that functioning relates to what the module would ordinarily do.

Cross-modal plasticity refers to the ability of your brain's modules to reorganize themselves somewhat to take advantage of cortical modules not being used due to sensory loss. For example, loss or absence of vision can stimulate some brain module reorganization, enhancing a blind person's sense of pitch and direction. Blind individuals often have extraordinary musical skills.

The effect of plasticity is much more evident in childhood. In blind people, pitch discrimination (the ability to judge the direction of extremely rapid pitch change) is much keener than in sighted people, especially if the individual became blind before the age of two. It's easier to learn to play a musical instrument or to speak more than one language in childhood because the brain is receptive to applying its built-in music

and language processing modules to any language and any musical culture during childhood. After a period of time, called the critical period, plasticity diminishes sharply as the various modules become fully functional. If you don't learn early, your brain is pre-wired to move on to the next stage, and you lose the window of opportunity.

# 1.3.15  
MENTALESE: THINKING WITHOUT LANGUAGE

Contrary to popular mythology, the language you speak does not mould or shape the way you think. An Arabic-speaking person, for example, does not "think differently" from the way an English-speaking person thinks.

You do not even need language to think. Humans (and other animals) use a "brain language," the language of thought, usually called mentalese. If thoughts depended on words, nobody would be able to translate anything from one language to another. The words of the French language do not all have exact equivalents in, say, English. The translation, then, is thought for thought, not word for word. The translator uses mentalese to make decisions on how to structure the thoughts across the languages.

You, like everybody, sometimes have problems putting thoughts into words. That's not because your thoughts don't exist; of course they do. Putting them into words means translating mentalese into language. That can be a chore.

When you finish reading this chapter of this book, you might remember only one or two of the specific sentences. But that does not mean you will have forgotten the content of the chapter (unless you haven't been paying attention). What you will remember is the gist of this chapter. You will easily be able give your friends a fairly detailed oral summary of the chapter (and urge them in the strongest possible terms to buy this interesting and highly informative book), but you will not likely use any of the exact sentences you read in this chapter, because you won't remember them.

You will remember the gist of this chapter in mentalese, the language of thought. The same applies to other experiences you have, such as seeing a movie or attending a party. Not only do you absorb the gist of the story line as revealed in the dialogue of the movie (or conversations you had at the party), but you also remember information that other modules have captured during the experience, such as the visual and auditory elements. Later, you can describe not only the gist of the dialogue, but also the gist of the visual setting, the soundscape, and how the experience made you feel emotionally. Mentalese captures the gist of all of this. You don't store all of it permanently, of course; memories fade over time. Chapter 7 discusses the various types and functions of memory.

Similarly, you can identify a familiar piece of music, even though you hear it in a completely transformed arrangement, played with unfamiliar instruments. You

recognize the unfamiliar rendition because you retain the gist of it. For example, you can recognize "My Favourite Things" from The Sound of Music even if it's played in a jazz arrangement you've never heard before. By John Coltrane.

Humans, of all the animal species on this planet, have the largest brain proportion comprised of neocortex ( 80%80% of the whole brain). However other animals also have a neocortex brain part, which means they, too, think-even though they don't have language. Your dog thinks. Your horse thinks. The mountain lion that has been tracking you and your horse thinks. She thinks (translated from mentalese), "Easy dinner or what?"

# 1.3.16

## ANIMAL INTELLIGENCE AND CULTURE

Evolutionary conservation means that, even after a species splits into two species (then splits again and again) due to environmental selective pressures that differ in geographically separated populations, many traits continue on in each species. For example, we humans share most of our genetic material with chimpanzees and bonobos, and we also share many chimpanzee and bonobo behavioural traits, even though the last common ancestor of apes and humans lived some six or seven million years ago.

All species, including humans, evolved from a common ancestor. So it's not surprising to find examples of human-like "mindfulness" in species other than humans. Lots of species make tools spontaneously, without any instruction from other adults of their species (or humans). Some species can learn to make tools, as well (cultural transmission).

Animals don't compose human-like music, and few appreciate Coltrane, Joni Mitchell, or the harmonica music that comes wafting out of nowhere when Marshal McDillon, Deputy Fester, and Ms Puma are sitting around the campfire roasting squirrels. However, some animals have recognizable cultural traits.

A few examples:

- Monkeys and apes in captivity, including chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and capuchin monkeys, like to paint pictures. Some can produce recognizable shapes such as crosses, circles, and non-random patterns.
    
- Dogs can learn word meanings after a single exposure (called fast mapping, which is how children pick up vocabulary so quickly) and fetch specific objects from verbal commands only.
    
- Chimps, bonobos, and gorillas, with a lot of training, can learn to associate some words with some objects. (However, they don't even begin to "get" the symbolic essence of language.)
    
- Capuchin monkeys can learn to use money. Male capuchins even purchase sex with money.
    
- Ravens and apes deliberately cheat or fool each other when it's advantageous.
    
- Chimpanzees use tools and teach tool-making and tool-use to other chimpanzees.
    
- Crows make and use tools without being taught by other crows or by humans.
    
- Male zebra finches are aware of the social relationships of others of their species, and modify their relationships with females accordingly.
    
- Baboons can transmit local baboon cultural practices to outsider baboons who join the troop.
    
- If you whisper the right things in your horse's ear, you can lead him to water and make him float on his back.

## Nowhere in the Brain: The "Blank Slate" MYth

Give me a dozen healthy infants, well-formed, and my own specified world to bring them up in and I'll guarantee to take any one at random and train him to become any type of specialist I might select-doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant-chief, and yes, even beggar-man and thief, regardless of his talents, penchants, tendencies, abilities, vocations, and race of his ancestors. -JOHN WATSON, father of behaviourism In the first half of the 20th 20th  Century, and well into the second half, a school of thought called behaviourism taught, wrongly, that

- Humans are born with "blank slate" brains, and
    
- Everything we learn comes from the punishments and rewards we receive from the environment.
    

Behaviourists conveniently forgot to explain how a blank slate brain could actually learn anything: a truly blank slate would have no mechanism for learning. If the brain were a blank slate at birth, you would not be able to learn either language or music.

According to behaviorists, observing behaviour from the outside, via stimulus and response, was the only valid way to proceed in psychology. Behaviourists believed that biology controlled animals, but culture controlled people. Presumably, behaviourists did not consider people to be animals. (Perhaps the Jesuits invented behaviourism, as evidenced in their oft-quoted myth: "Give me the child until the age of seven, and I will give you the man.")

Many people still believe in behaviourism, even in the face of mountains of evidence supporting the existence, at birth, of a wide variety of naturally selected brain adaptations such as those for the acquisition of language and music. Some academics even teach that cultural evolution has superceded biological evolution.

For example, even today, "social constructionists" cling to the Standard Social Science Model, the dogma that biology doesn't matter. In the minds of social constructionists, a biological trait such as the state of being male or female-your gender-arises somehow through the prevailing culture's "social construction." That is, social constructionists actually believe you are not born male or female, you "learn" your gender, and you "learn" your sexual orientation.

This makes about as much sense as insisting people are born with "blank slate" bodies. At birth, humans have a head (containing a blank slate brain, of course) that's attached to a formless blank slate body. A blob. When you're born, presumably, the attending obstetrician or midwife begins to shape you-a blob-into a torso, then arms and legs and fingers and toes. Others in the social environment join in, shaping other bits of you-the-blob into your heart and lungs and, let's not forget, your naughty bits. Over the years, society colonizes and socially constructs your blank slate brain and teaches you what gender you are...

Thinking about the brain and behaviour has changed since the days of the behaviourists, as summarized by the cognitive neuroscientist, Michael S. Gazzaniga:

No scientist seriously questions whether we are the product of natural selection. We are a finely honed machine that has amazing capacities for learning and inventiveness. Yet these capacities were not picked up at a local bookstore or developed from everyday experience. The abilities to learn and think come with our brains. The knowledge we acquire with these devices results from interactions with our culture. But the devices come with the brain, just as the brakes come with the car.

# 1.3.18  
Cultural Relativism

Believers in the Standard Social Science Model refuse to make value judgments about anything that goes on in a culture other than their own. This is called cultural relativism or the relativistic fallacy. It's really moral relativism, although believers in cultural relativism deny it.

According to cultural relativism, all cultures are "equal." So you must not condemn the practices of any culture other than your own. Practices such as barring women from positions of social, political, or religious power. Banning music. Arranging and forcing marriages between three-year-old children. Ostracising, torturing, or executing homosexuals. Cultural relativists insist that, if you're an outsider, you have no business criticizing such cultural practices. If you do, you're an intolerant, ethnocentric racist bigot.

Cultural relativists assume, contrary to empirical evidence, that:

1. Culture creates the individual instead of the other way around, and
2. People do not have shared cultural values, the same biologically-driven wants, needs, and aspirations everywhere in the world, regardless of culture.

Cultural relativists simply deny, in the face of all evidence, that there's any such thing as human nature-a large group of inborn behavioural traits that are common to people of all cultures. According to cultural relativists, everything's political. Everything's subjective. There's no such thing as an objective fact.

The implication of cultural relativism is that universal, inborn ethical or moral standards do not exist. Cultural relativism is based on the mistaken notion that people learn morality and therefore you ought to expect people in different cultures to have different senses of morality.

The evidence, however, indicates every normal member of the human species is born with an evolved moral sense. Morality is not something you acquire from your culture. You don't learn morality from your Mom or by attending your local church, mosque, or synagogue. Atheists, agnostics, and orphans behave just as morally as everybody else in society.

### 1.3.19

## A DeSERT ISLAND ThOUGHT EXPERIMENT

Consider what would happen in the following hypothetical situation, proposed by the anthropologist, Robin Fox.

Suppose a population of children were to find itself in total social isolation, having to raise themselves, without ever having had any contact with adults and a pre-existing culture. No previous enculturation whatsoever. Impossible in real life, of course, because we humans need others to feed and nurture us for a long time until we become self-sustaining. But this is only a thought experiment - nobody will die of starvation or exposure.

What would happen? Because humans have inborn brain adaptations, including adaptations for language and music, the individuals making up this hypothetical culture-free society would create culture, just as individual humans create culture everywhere in the world. The society would, among other things:

- Generate a language
- Have music
- Have dancing
- Create a legal system
- Create the institution of marriage
- Create systems of social status
- Proclaim and enforce taboos, such as the incest taboo
- Create some sort of religious faith, complete with ceremony and ritual
- Make and use tools and weapons
- Exclude women from various practices and institutions
- Have homosexual citizens
- Find itself inventing ways of coping with adultery, murder, suicide, psychosis, etc.

# 1.3.20

## The NONSENSE OF BIOLOGICAL DETERMINISM AND SOCIAL DETERMINISM

People who don't understand what evolutionary biology and evolutionary psychology are about fear they might be about biological determinism, the doctrine that your genes determine 100%100% of your abilities and behaviour, summoning ugly spectres of racism, eugenics, social Darwinism, and the like.

The scientific evidence does not support biological determinism, and no sane biologist embraces the concept. Its opposite, social determinism, the doctrine that society alone socially constructs 100%100% of your abilities and behaviour, also has no scientific support.

Evolutionary biology and psychology seek to understand what humans have in common as a species, not how we differ as individuals. This means taking into account the interactions between our biological adaptations and our cultural

environment. Evolution by conventional Darwinian natural selection created humans and all other living things on earth, past and present. Therefore, genetically inherited predispositions influence human behaviour as much as learning and cultural influences. Both genes and culture matter.

Moreover, you have the ability to override your genetically programmed inclinations. You have free will. For example, you can live and work in tall buildings with floor-to-ceiling windows, overriding your genetically inherited fear of heights. You can ride in an elevator despite natural claustrophobia.

The ability to override genetically inherited predispositions invalidates excuses, such as:

- I smashed that other guy's car with a tire iron in a fit of road rage because, as a human male, I'm naturally aggressive.
- I can't become a physicist because, as a human female, I'm not supposed to be good at math.
- I keep having affairs because, as a naturally polygynous human male, I just have to sow my wild oats.
- I eat wild oats from the nosebags of other horses because, as a horse instead of a human, I have no evolved ethical sense, only horse sense.

# SOCIAL DARWINISM: SPIN-DOCTORING SCIENCE

Social Darwinism is the notion that the same principle of natural selection that applies to biological evolution extends to individual and group behaviour-even though no evidence supports any such extension.

Political and social thinkers of the late 19th 19th  Century concocted the idea of social Darwinism: superior social and racial classes and systems succeed and survive, while inferior social and racial classes and systems fail and ought to die out. So, for example, you should not help sick or disabled people because if you did, you would interfere with the natural process of evolution. Social Darwinism was used to justify imperialism, racism, eugenics, and genocide.

Darwin himself never made any claims that natural selection applied to anything other than biological evolution. Nor do today's evolutionary biologists.

# 1.3.21

## HUMAN UNIVERSALS

Humans have so many naturally-selected behavioural characteristics in common, regardless of culture, that the anthropologist Donald E. Brown documented hundreds of them in a book, Human Universals. These include musical universals, coming up in a few minutes.

Brown describes the human species as Universal People, a nod to Chomsky's Universal Grammar. Here are a few from Brown's and others' compilations of human universals, the things you find in all cultures worldwide (Table 2):

## TABLE 2 A Small Sampling of Human Universals

These are only a few that Brown (and others) have documented. Brown's book lists many more. These traits exist in every culture, however separated geographically and historically. Obviously, such commonality of characteristics could not have emerged independently everywhere in humanity without genetic foundations-an evolved basic human nature.

# 1.3.22

## "The Genes Hold Culture On a Leash"

Does culture, including music and language, create human behaviour, or does human behaviour create culture?

Culture is what we learn from each other. It applies to both humans and to nonhuman animals that have culture (and many do).

But where does human culture come from in the first place? According to outmoded, biologically-unsupported thinking:

- Human babies are formless blank slates at birth.
- Therefore human culture comes from the "outside."
- Culture completely creates the human individual; the individual is the "product" of his or her culture.
- Cultural or social transformation can change the essential nature of people (this is precisely what ideologues, such as a political and religious extremists, aim to do).

In other words, according to this line of thinking, culture creates and controls people. The evidence paints a far different picture. All culture, including music, is biological in origin because culture originates, ultimately, in human brains, and manifests amazing similarity worldwide. What we humans think, what we know, and how we behave comes partly from our genetic inheritance, and partly from what we learn (using our brains) from the people we personally associate with, and the cultural artifacts we come in contact with, such as the television we watch and the music we listen to.

Our genes do not control us. But the culture around us does not control us, either. No amount of social engineering can change that. As the American biologist E. O. Wilson aptly put it in his Pulitzer Prize winning book, On Human Nature, "The genes hold culture on a leash."

We humans use our brains to create new, original culture all the time. But it's rarely so new and so original that it has nothing to do with our genetic

predispositions, notwithstanding the efforts of postmodern artists, including musicians.

## InHUMAN MUSIC OF THE BIOLOGICALLY UNINFORMED: POSTMODERNISM

It's one thing to create original art. It's another to create inhuman original art. Artistic movements such as postmodernism in music and other arts represent brave attempts by artists to break free of our evolved human nature.

It doesn't work. Human brains evolve with glacial slowness. Biologically, we humans still have brains adapted to Stone Age conditions, like it or not. Humans have been huntergatherers for more than 99 percent of human history. No amount of enculturation can change that.

Most people don't hang postmodern canvasses of meaningless stripes and blobs on their walls-unless under peer pressure. Nor do they read disjointed gibberish. Nor do they listen to atonal ("serial") music.

Cultural relativists insist all art is equal. No such thing as "good" art or "bad" art. A Sunday painter's crude rendering of Elvis has just as much aesthetic value as a Monet.

Consider these two paintings. One is Jan Vermeer's "The Music Lesson." The other is Barnett Newman's "Voice of

The Vermeer speaks for itself. As for "Voice of Fire"-it's exactly what you see: three vertical stripes, a work of "art" devoid of a scintilla of imagination or skill. The National Gallery in Ottawa, Canada authorized the payment of $1.76$1.76 million for "Voice of Fire." Cultural relativists deemed it a bargain.

If you criticize the spending of that amount of money on a panel consisting of three stripes - the type of design you would see at a shopping mall food courtyou're obviously some narrow-minded Philistine, judging something of which you have no cultural knowledge, something that's out of your cultural experience. "Voice of Fire" is a genuine Barnett Newman, after all. A national art gallery paid $1.76$1.76 million for it, so it must be worth the money. Hey, for that kind of money, it has to be a masterpiece!

The emperor has no clothes. If no one knew it was a genuine Barnett Newman, "Voice of Fire" might fetch as much as $10$10 at a yard sale-the value of the canvas or plywood or whatever it's painted on (the thing is pretty big).

It's unlikely anyone in their right mind would hang a poster-size reproduction of "Voice of Fire" on their wall. But lots of people hang reproductions of "The Music Lesson."

From a commercial standpoint, the National Gallery in Ottawa has probably recouped its financial investment in "Voice of Fire" from the admission fees of incredulous visitors who just had to find out for themselves if the gallery actually did purchase a panel painted with three stripes for $1.76$1.76 million, and did provide wall space for it, instead of a work of art.

As for music ... a cultural relativist would insist that you have to consider a musical piece within its cultural milieu, so all music is equally valid. There's no such thing as a "good" song or a "bad" song. Artistic merit is too subjective to be judged or measured. A 12-year-old's first attempt at songwriting has just as much artistic merit as "Georgia On My Mind."

This kind of thinking is utterly delusional because it ignores or denies the reality of evolved human nature.

# POSTMODERN ANIMAL ART, POSTMODERN CHILD ART, POSTMODERN SCIENCE!

If you saw a chimpanzee-painted picture, you probably wouldn't pay $5$5 for it-unless you knew that a chimp painted the picture. In that case, you might pay lots of money for it. The 'art' of Congo the chimpanzee (1954 - 1964) has sold for tens of thousands of dollars.

Similarly, four-year-old Maria Olmstead's postmodern paintings ('abstract art'), indistinguishable from postmodern paintings in

New York's finest galleries of indistinguishable postmodern paintings, have sold for thousands of dollars each.

Postmodern artists get much attention in the media ... but what about postmodern socio-political critics and cultural analysts? Doesn't their gibberish deserve more attention, too?

Alan Sokal, a New York University physicist thought so. Fed up with denials of reality and the downplaying of scientific evidence by postmodern intellectuals insistent on promulgating claptrap about the "social construction of reality," Sokal decided to try a little experiment to determine whether or not postmodern relativists had any ability to recognize pure, unadulterated bullshit when it hit them in the face.

Sokal wrote an article titled, "Transgressing the boundaries: Towards a transformative hermeneutics of quantum gravity." He submitted it to the well-known postmodern cultural studies journal, Social Text. The 35-page article was a hoax, full of wooly postmodern jargon and scientific-sounding absurdities about the implications of quantum physics on social culture, and the role of postmodern science. The bafflegab and the scientific credibility of the author impressed the editors of Social Text. They did not bother to have the article reviewed by scientists who would have known immediately that it was ludicrous twaddle from beginning to end. Instead, Social Text published the article-even though they could not possibly have had any understanding of it, since it was meaningless.

Musicians unaware of evolutionary biology and its implications often create incomprehensible, inhuman music in an attempt to come up with something original-musical equivalents of "Voice of Fire" or chimpanzee art or Marla Olmstead's "abstract" paintings. "Surely," the argument goes, "it's time to move on from tonal music. We have to progress!"-without realizing that the notion of progress does not apply to the arts, including music (more on this in Chapter 2).

A postmodern chef would presumably create bold new original dishes by incorporating ingredients such as coal dust, Styrofoam, and plutonium. Not many humans eat inhuman food. And not many humans appreciate inhuman music and inhuman visual art. (Some do, though ... )

If you write and perform "postmodern" songs, you will probably have a problem making a living. Inhuman music means inaccessible music. Inaccessible music does not communicate emotionally (except to irritate the listener) because the human brain cannot find meaning in it on any level. It's not because listeners aren't

sophisticated enough. It's because the music itself amounts to pretentious, meaningless rubbish.

## Musical Universals

Similar musical elements show up to some degree in the music of all cultures. For example, Westerners listening to Hindustani music report feeling the same specific emotions as the emotions Hindustani musicians report they are intending to convey. Similarly, young children specify the same emotions elicited by a piece of music as do adults. If you could time-travel, you would find the same musical universals in the music of cultures that went extinct tens of thousands of years ago.

Today, music likely tops the list of all the artistic activities humans practise globally. Here are some musical universals (Table 3)—musical traits found in all musical cultures worldwide (not necessarily characteristic of every individual, but in pretty much all cultures):

## TABLE 3 Some Musical Universals

Cadence Children's music as its own genre Dancing to musical accompaniment Emotions aroused by the same musical information are the same emotions (i.e., not dependent on previous exposure or knowledge of the music being played) Harmonic sensing automatic (i.e., ability to sense a note and relate it harmonically to other notes) Infants' ability to discriminate differences in pitch and timing Intervals with small-integer frequency ratios, such as octaves, fifths, and fourths Melody, and grouping of melodic notes into sequences Music considered as art Music listening involves rhythmic bodily movement (entrainment) Music not a rare talent

Music used in ritual or religious practice Music used to mark important events Musical instruments Phrase as the basic unit of musical structure Resources and time dedicated to music are substantial (applies as much to industrial societies as to hunter-gatherer societies) Rhythm based on isometric beats Rhythmic pulse groupings of 2 or 3 beats Scales of 7 or fewer different pitches to the octave Scales with unequal steps, such as the pentatonic scale Song classification/categorization Songs with short repetitive phrases within a range of a perfect fifth Symmetry in musical structure/form Vocal music, practised by both men and women

How Much of Music Is Innate, How Much Is Culturally Acquired?

You owe your ability to appreciate and create music to the genes you inherited from your parents and their ancestors, going back many thousands of generations. But the specifics of your musical tastes and musical creativity come primarily from the cultural preferences of your peer group-not from your parents. This applies to your nonmusical cultural preferences as well.

Imagine this sequence of events.

- You are born in a small village in South Korea. As a child, you become fluent in the Korean language, absorb the Korean folk music traditions of your parents, and observe their Buddhist religious practices.
- When you are six years old, your family emigrates to America and settles in Dodge City, Kansas. Your parents learn practically no English, retain their strong Buddhist faith, and socialize only with other Koreans in Dodge City's small Korean neighbourhood. At home, you and your parents converse exclusively in Korean.

Fast forward a few years.

- Now you are 11 years old. You've been going to school in Dodge for five years. Your parents can still hardly speak a word of English, still hang around with their Korean friends, and remain firm Buddhists.

As for you...

- You now speak fluent English with an accent indistinguishable from the accent of your native-born American posse in Dodge. You also dress like them, swagger around like them, ride horses like them, and have habits and tastes and religious interests like theirs.
- You walk and talk and identify with your Dodge peer group-not your parents and the Korean world they still inhabit.
- In short, you inhabit a personal environment of your own, an environment that overlaps with the personal environments of your peer group. It shows. You still have the genetic inheritance of your parents, of course, but the specific cultural information you have acquired has come mainly from your

peer group. And that includes not just your language, but also your musical tastes.

How much of is music innate, and how much is culturally acquired? Probably something like half and half. But you can't disentangle genetically inherited influence from culturally acquired influence because musical universals show up in varying degrees in the music of all cultures.

## Where Is Music? Woven in the Fabric of Life Globally

Most people experience music every day. One study revealed a 44%44% probability of experiencing music in any two-hour period.

This doesn't mean that people are actually paying attention to the music they hear. That doesn't happen much. Music hangs around in the social environment.

- People often focus on music as a diversion when doing mundane work or chores.
- People also listen to music to regulate their own mood-to get out of a bad mood, get into a romantic mood, get into an excited mood.

According to one study, adolescent girls tend to use music as a mood regulator. Boys use music to make an impression on others. Boys also like to listen to music when alone, assimilating identity-building cultural stereotypes.

Music weaves its way through the fabric of everyday life everywhere: waking up, getting ready for work or school, eating, working, travelling, playing, courting, meditating, praying, horse grooming, shopping, exercising, socializing, trying to get to sleep.

## WHERE? WHAT ABOUT OUTSIDE THE BRAIN?

Music originates solely in the brain. Or does it? Could global consciousness, or mass consciousness generally, influence music-making? Is there such a thing as global consciousness?

In 1998, researchers at Princeton University set up an international global consciousness monitoring system. They began placing dozens of electronic random event generators (REGs) in many countries around the world. These devices continue to generate sequential data completely at random. The REGs are independent of one another, so they cannot influence each other. Each REG periodically uploads its random data to the lab at Princeton.

The purpose of the experiment was land still is to test the following hypothesis:

The composite variation of the distribution means of data sequences (segments) recorded from multiple REGs during broadly engaging global events will deviate from expectation.

In other words, if global consciousness exists, and if it's detectable with existing technology, then it should affect REGgenerated data during events where large numbers of people are thinking about the same thing at the same time. Examples of events would include:

- A major terrorist attack such as 9/11
- An election
- A natural disaster such as a major earthquake or hurricane
- A mass-media event such as an international fundraising musical extravaganza

When comparing the data from one REG with the data from another, you would expect to find no statistical correlations beyond what would be expected by chance, if human thinking did not influence the electronically-generated data from the REGs.

But the results of the Princeton experiment, which have been reported continuously since 1998, show numerous statistically significant REG data correlations associated with major humanly important events. The closer the event is physically located to a REG, the greater the effect on the REG data.

While the results neither "prove" nor "disprove" specific cause-and-effect claims, they do provide solid evidence supporting the hypothesis of the investigators.

The scientific rigour with which the monitoring and reporting system was established, and the results it has produced, make the Princeton experiment one of the most fascinating ever devised. You can find out about it and have a look at the results

## When Did Music Get Started?

## The "WHEN" Question: SCIENCE vs RELIGION

Science shares with religion the claim that it answers deep questions about origins, the nature of life, and the cosmos. But there the resemblance ends. Scientific beliefs are supported by evidence, and they get results. Myths and faiths are not and do not. -RICHARD DAWKINS, eminent British zoologist Why is there something instead of nothing? -HANS KUNG, eminent Swiss theologian Empirical evidence indicates Darwinian evolution created in you and in all other humans an adaptation for music in the form of an integrated network of brain modules (neuronal circuits) that enable you to make music and respond emotionally to music.

According to certain religious doctrines, talk of Darwinian evolution amounts to nonsense or even blasphemy: God made man, and God bestows the gift of music as God sees fit. (Or, certain specific gods, depending upon the religion.)

Science has succeeded spectacularly in explaining nature and making factual information available for the creation of incredible technologies, from flying machines to nuclear weapons to life-saving medicines to guitars and pianos. Science keeps us atop the food chain and able to protect ourselves (most of the time) from the most lethal of natural non-human predators.

Most religions hypothesize (but promulgate as truth) divine creation, external, objectifiable forces of good and evil, an afterlife, and some sort of heaven and hell.

But sincere belief in religious doctrine does not make it true. The evidence supporting Darwinian evolution directly contradicts such claims, earning the enduring hostility of strongly committed religious adherents who believe

in the unchangeable doctrines and "received truths" of their faith, and do not tolerate free inquiry, evidence, or critical thinking.

In one notorious case in America in the 1920s, a high school science teacher stood trial for teaching evolution, in violation of Tennessee law. The court convicted him (Scopes Monkey Trial). Some U. S. states still occasionally pass anti-evolution statutes, though courts now tend to pay more attention to the constitutional principle of separation of church and state.

# RELIGION AS AN ADAPTATION

But that the dread of something after death, The undiscover'd country from whose bourn No traveller returns, puzzles the will And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of? -SHAKESPEARE (Hamlet, III, I) Religion may actually be a behavioural adaptation. Religious beliefs are hypotheses that try to explain things people can't understand or figure out, for lack of information or evidence, "attempts of the human mind to impose some kind of order on the chaos of existence."

No credible evidence exists that any species, including Homo sapiens, has a higher purpose beyond survival and procreation-i.e., sending genes into the next generation. If, as biological evidence suggests, religious faith is a biological adaptation, the selective pressure that created it has some obvious functions. Religious faith...

- Helps protect adherents (the overwhelming majority of humankind) from depression, anxiety, and suicide-although some adherents use suicide as a ticket to "paradise," such as the 9/11 terrorists and countless suicide bombers.
- Provides a sense of well-being by"answering" profound questions. The human species made it to the top of the food chain by understanding cause-and-effect. Where no cause-and-effect evidence exists, religious faith stands in. Believers report higher levels of happiness and life satisfaction, compared with non-religious peers.
- Provides adherents with membership in a powerful group, and all the survival advantages that go with such affiliation.

The hypothesis that religion is an adaptation would predict that religious faith would be prevalent in all societies, regardless of level of technological advancement, in nations such as India as well as in nations such as America.

Religions compete with each other much as businesses compete with each other for mind share and market share. Winning religions flourish and spread through proselytizing and warfare, then die away and become mythologies (e.g., Roman and Greek religions are now considered mythologies). A mythology, it is said, is a religion that has gone out of fashion. Odds are, in the unlikely event humankind does not fight or poison itself into extinction over the next few centuries or millennia, today's religions will pass into official mythology. New religions will prevail, deifying Captain Kirk, Harry Potter, and Paris Hilton. (Perhaps the Hilton hotel in Paris will assume the religious significance now associated with the Vatican.)

Religion has been around for tens of thousands of years-far longer than any of today's Johnny-come-lately religions such as Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam land secular religions such as Marxism and Nazism). And much longer than any of recorded history's extinct religions. According to one anthropological estimate, humankind has created perhaps 100,000 religions over tens of thousands of years. A 35,000-yearold cave painting in Italy, for example, clearly shows a maskwearing shaman or wizard, hands outstretched, likely performing some sort of ritual. As well, there is evidence that the species Homo neanderthalensis, a species distinctly different from our own, had religion some 60,000 years ago.

As for brain location of the "religion" adaptation, damage to the right frontal lobe significantly alters a person's religious and political beliefs and values. Who knows, perhaps a little poking around in the right frontal lobe would transform Pat Robertson from an intemperate Christian fundamentalist into an intemperate Islamic fundamentalist.

Religious and Political Assaults on Music

From time to time throughout history, religious and political leaders, recognizing the power of music to engage people emotionally, have sought to quash it, sometimes brutally.

A few examples:

- The Christian church obstructed the development of polyphony and harmony because religious leaders realized music elicits emotion, including pleasure, which was contrary to church doctrine.
- The Nazis banned jazz in the 1930s because black people played it and Jewish people encouraged and financed its development.
- The communist Chinese dictatorship, when it seized power in1949, banned jazz, the music of the bourgeois capitalist West.
- Various American churches with white congregations and racist agendas have periodically banned specific types of "immoral" African American music, sometimes targeting particular performers.
- In Afghanistan in 1996, the Taliban seized power and imposed a hideous form of religious fascism on the country. For the next five years, the Taliban's Islamic police force visited incredible horrors and atrocities on various sectors of the population, especially women. The Taliban banned education for girls, blew up works of art, and outlawed music. Playing or enjoying music was deemed "un-Islamic." Musicians resisted by going underground and continuing to make music.
- In Algeria in the 1990s, Islamic death squads specifically targeted, hunted down, and murdered musicians for their "un-Islamic" musical activities.

# 1.4.3

## Ultimate Origin of the Adaptation for MUSIC: COMMON DesCEnt

DNA and palaeontological evidence indicates all life on earth began from one replicating molecule nearly four billion years ago. Every living thing on earth uses the same 64 -word DNA "dictionary" of codons, practically conclusive evidence that all life on earth descended from the same molecular ancestor. This phenomenon is known as common descent. The origin of life amounted to the origin of heredity.

Today, for example, humans and flies share much of the same genetic material. So do humans and mice. As previously mentioned, humans, bonobos, and chimpanzees share more than 98%98% of the same DNA. The genomes of chimpanzees and humans have been sequenced and compared, and show remarkable similarity.

Humans share some similar behaviour characteristics with chimpanzees, such as male aggression and tool use. Yet, despite genomic similarity, enough genetic differences exist to make humans and chimps far different species.

# EVOLUTION IS "JUST A HYPOTHESIS"? RUBBISH

Evolution is a bankrupt speculative philosophy, not a scientific fact. Only a spiritually bankrupt society could ever believe it. ...Only atheists could accept this Satanic theory.

- JIMMY SWAGGART, American fundamentalist preacher

Science admits and encourages criticism and testing, making it essentially self-correcting. Scientists do not consider anything as absolutely true for all time. Religionists and political ideologues do.

Scientists consider well-supported hypotheses, usually called theories, to be as factual as you can get without resorting to religion-like proclamations of absolute truth. Newton's theory of gravitation applies on a scale humans can relate to, but Einstein's theory applies on a cosmic scale. As for evolution, the evidence for its reality is massive. James D. Watson, American biologist, codiscoverer of the structure of DNA, and Nobel prize winner, puts it this way:

Today, evolution is an accepted fact for everyone but a fundamentalist minority, whose objections are based not on reasoning but on doctrinaire adherence to religious principles.

Mr. Swaggart apparently does not agree with most Christians of the major denominations, who, in the face of overwhelming evidence, accept the reality of evolution without abandoning their faith. Some 18 years after his election, even Pope John Paul II finally allowed as how... fresh knowledge leads to the recognition of the theory of evolution as more than just a hypothesis.

Perhaps the Pope was mindful of the actions of one of his predecessors, the "infallible" Pope Urban VIII, who sentenced Galileo to a life of house arrest for daring to agree with

Copernicus that the earth is not the centre of the universe, and in fact all the planets, including the earth, revolve around the sun.

From the moment Darwin published his theory in 1859, religious adherents have opposed it because, in their minds, evolution "dethrones God." For some 70 or 80 years after Darwin's theory was published, most people-even biologists-refused, on various religious and moral grounds, to consider that Darwinian natural selection might be right. Philosophers held out even longer, until the middle of the 20th 20th  Century.

Research on human mindset indicates humans hold on to core political and religious beliefs even in the face of compelling, contra-indicating factual evidence because they don't want to have to cope with the emotional stress involved in modifying beliefs.

Those who simply do not wish to believe scientific evidence that conflicts with strongly held religious faith try to discredit evolutionary theory ("shoot the messenger").

It's interesting to note that more than 80%80% of U. S. teenagers believe God created human beings, either directly, by creating us in our present form within the last 10,000 years, or indirectly by guiding the evolutionary process so that we would end up the way we are. Only 20%20% of adults with a high school education or less believe that Darwinian evolution is a well-supported scientific theory. The remaining 80%80% presumably believe evolution is "just a hypothesis." Education tends to dispel belief in creation mythology. The proportion of believers in creation mythology plummets to 35%35% among adults with a post-graduate education. But that still means 35%35% of adults with a postgraduated education refuse to believe the scientific evidence supporting Darwinian evolution.

The first replicating molecule originated in one of two ways:

1. In situ hypothesis. Until recently, pre-biotic chemists believed life originated in the chemical cauldron that was the earth's surface several billion years ago.
2. Panspermia hypothesis. Today, in light of new evidence, the panspermia hypothesis seems more likely. Life may not have had an earthly origin. On more than one occasion, astronomers have observed "sugar clouds" floating around in the Milky Way-some of the same organic material contained in comets that smash into the earth every so often (not too often!). If this is how

life on earth got kick started nearly 4 billion years ago, it probably happened on countless other planets in our galaxy and other galaxies.

How did non-life turn into life? In popular mythology, life begins with "ensoulment," which occurs at the "moment of conception." In fact, there's no such thing as a moment of conception. The biological process of conception takes up to 48 hours to complete. Similarly, no sharp demarcation exists between non-life and life. Viruses, for example, have either DNA or RNA, but are not considered to be "alive" until they infect host cells, where they replicate and behave like life forms, sort of.

Scientists can create organic compounds in the lab, including some of the lifeessential amino acids, by simulating conditions on earth billions of years ago. Twocarbon sugar, such as the sugar in the observed galactic sugar clouds, is not far removed from RNA. In the presence of minerals such as borax, simple sugars stop reacting at five carbons, the carbon sugars of life. Not only that, a form of evolution by natural selection (but not life) was set in motion in the lab in some remarkable experiments by the molecular biologist Sol Spiegelman.

DNA replication, like the generation of sentences and musical phrases, is combinatorial. A finite number of genes creates a practically infinite number of combinations. That's why the absolute number of genes in the genome of a given species has practically nothing to do with the complexity of the organism. Humans have only about 25,000 to 30,000 genes. Other species have more.

However, scientists will never be able to artificially create life as we know it in a lab, for several good reasons:

- The first life on earth evolved without oxygen. Even today, living organisms at the bottom of the ocean surrounding undersea vents metabolize sulphur instead of oxygen.
- DNA almost certainly had a replicating forerunner, long extinct.
- Life today consists of cells, which are extremely complex, exquisitely functioning units that took billions of years to evolve from scratch. They contain many thousands of molecules and ions. No one is going to artificially create a living cell in the lab from scratch anytime soon.

# "SUPER BOWL" JANET, APPEARING AT YOUR LOCAL MADRASAH

One day, millions of atoms that now constitute Janet Jackson's naked right "Super Bowl" breast will mingle merrily with atoms

of the eyeballs of fanatical fundamentalists, ensconced in their madrasahs.

After you die, your body's trillions of atoms slowly but surely make their way back into the atmosphere, and way beyond. Nature recycles atoms.

Right now, you probably have, built into our own body, millions of atoms of Plato, Cleopatra, Helen of Troy, and Guido d'Arezzo. And anyone else you care to name who lived many centuries ago.

## Timeline of Musical Evolution

Here are some significant points in evolutionary history, focussing on events of musical significance (all dates approximate, of course).

- 3.8 to 3.9 billion years ago: The original replicator starts replicating.
- 500 million years ago: Life forms begin to sense sound.
- 5 to 7 million years ago: Hominid line splits from other primates. Last common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans probably lived about 7 million years ago.

Oldest known hominid could be Sahelanthropus tchandensis, about 6 million years old. Or it could be Ardipthecus kadabba, also about 6 million years old. Or some other two-legged critter with a fancy Latin name.

Hominids arose in Africa. Key characteristic of hominids is that all were bipedal-the first significant trait that separated early hominids from great ape species. This led to rearrangement of internal organs now characteristic of modern humans, the only hominid species that has not (yet) gone extinct.

Due to bipedalism, humans have a unique respiratory tract, compared with our non-bipedal close relatives such as chimpanzees and gorillas. Humans

have better control of breathing, and this probably facilitated the evolution of language and vocal music.

Proto-music and language may have begun soon after the hominid branch split from the common ancestor of humans and today's great apes. However, bipedalism did not lead directly to encephalation (brain expansion). Hominids were walking upright for several million years before encephalation began.

For the first 5 million years of hominid evolution, the dominant species were various runty little Australopithecines ("austral" means "southern," as in southern Africa; nothing to do with Australia).

- 2.4 million years ago: The genus Homo appears. That's our genus. About a dozen Homo species eventually evolved, all of which became extinct except H. sapiens.

Most human evolution took place in the Palaeolithic Age, also known as the Old Stone Age, a time period recognized by palaeontologists and archaeologists that began about 2.5 million years ago and ended about 12,000 years ago. (In geology, the equivalent period is called the Pleistocene epoch- 1.8 million years ago to about 12,000 years ago.)

It is possible that music has existed in all species of the genus Homo. However, it's hard to know exactly when music began because musical instruments made of reeds or trees or animal hides decay into dust and leave no fossil evidence. Also, the vocal apparatus is made of soft tissue, which decays into dust, except for the hyoid bone, which occasionally fossilizes.

Evidence from the fossil record indicates a modern respiratory system in the genus Homo at least 1.5 million years ago, with traits such as a barrel chest and projecting nose-requirements for producing both vocal music and words. So it's conceivable that singing and language go back that far. Apes, due to their vocal tract anatomy, do not have the ability to produce consonants, and, therefore, spoken language.

- 2.4 million years ago: MYH16 mutation in genus Homo that may have enabled encephalation.
- 2 million years ago: Evidence of encephalation already underway in genus Homo. Skull size eventually triples to present-day size.

Selective pressure drove the evolution of a variety of social bonding adaptations, including music and language, and thereby drove encephalation.

Although a few animals have brains that exceed the size of the human brain, the important thing is the ratio of brain size to body weight. By this measure, Homo sapiens easily tops the podium as the brainiest species on the planet.

The American palaeontologist Stephen Jay Gould, among others, studied the ratio of brain size to body weight in other hominids and other primates, and concluded, "...our brain has undergone a true increase in size not related to the demands of our larger body. We are, indeed, smarter than we were."

- 800,000 to 1 million years ago: Evidence from archaeology that hominids controlled fire. A milestone in music: the first campfire songs!
- 200,000 years ago: Early modern Homo sapiens appears.
- 200,000 years ago: Unfairly maligned Homo neanderthalensis appears. Became extinct approximately 30,000 years ago. H. neanderthalensis was a hardy, intelligent species distinct from H. sapiens, and with a larger brain. DNA evidence shows Homo sapiens did not "descend" from Neanderthals, nor interbreed with Neanderthals.

A Neanderthal hyoid bone-the horseshoe-shaped bone above the larynxfrom about 45,000 years ago has pretty much the same shape as a modern human hyoid bone. Neanderthals also had other cranial characteristics required for vocal music and speech, which fall well within the human range. Neanderthals probably spoke and sang and had similar mental abilities as HH. sapiens.

It is entirely possible that our species, H. sapiens, killed off H. neanderthalensis. Early genocide.

- 115,000 years ago: Fully modern Homo sapiens (Africa).
- 60,00060,000 to 100,000100,000 years ago: A relatively small number of modern humans leaves Africa. DNA and other evidence strongly indicates all humans today are descended from this small group.

Since they were biologically the same as us, they must have had language. And since music either preceded or co-evolved with language, they must have had music.

- 75,000 years ago: Evidence of human use of symbolism (Africa), the hallmark of human culture. Humans were using beads made from shells, not merely for decoration, but to communicate meaning.
- 44,000 years ago: Oldest known well-documented musical instrument, a bone flute. This means it's likely people commonly made flutes from other materials such as hollowed-out plant stems. (Cultures already had highly developed visual art by this time.)

The fossil record shows Homo neanderthalensis made this bone flute-not Homo sapiens. As a musical instrument, the Neanderthal bone flute is sophisticated and not obvious. (Other inventions that seem simple and obvious, such as the wheel, only arose in the past few thousand years.)

The Neanderthal bone flute has four holes spaced such that the sound corresponds to whole and half-steps of the diatonic scale.

Percussion instruments likely predated melodic instruments by hundreds of thousands of years. Human vocal music certainly predated music played on percussion instruments.

- 32,000 years ago: Symbolic markings on bone, clay, stones, and ornaments reveal that elementary literacy is well in place by this time.

# MUSIC NOTATION: THE "FROZEN ARTIFACT OF THE SCORE"

Music without notation, like language without writing, goes back hundreds of thousands of years.

The technologies of notating music and language are relatively recent non-instinctive cultural constructs, invented in the past few thousand years. Being non-instinctive inventions, written language and music require specific schooling to master.

A piece of notated music, like an architect's drawing, amounts to a technical, symbolic representation of the real thing.

When you play or sing a piece of music from notation, the "frozen artifact of the score," what you play never corresponds exactly to the notation. A computer can do that, you can't. The difference between what's notated on the page and what you

actually sing or play constitutes your personal style (not counting unintended errors).

When you notate music, you code sound, which gets decoded during performance. At the same time, the brains of listeners recode the sound, thereby experiencing music.

A lot of music teaching obsesses on the technical 'codingdecoding' aspects of music. And especially on eliminating "errors." Playing each note absolutely "correctly." Exactly as notated. Never mind emotional substance and content. Many students who take years of conservatory lessons can sight read the most complex classical pieces, yet have no real understanding of how music works, and could not play a Hank Williams song without the sheet music.

Notating music used to be the only way to make a permanent record of a song or other piece of music. If you were a songwriter and did not know how to notate, you had to either learn how, or find someone to do it for you.

When personal recording technology came along, you could create a permanent record of a song without having to learn music notation.

Now, with digital technology, you can use any number of hardware and software products to turn the music you play into musical notation-for the benefit of musicians who don't know how to play by ear.

It's the age of post-literate musicianship. If you own a computer and have the right software, you can create elaborate music without ever having to learn to play a musical instrument.

# 1.4.5  
DID MUSIC AND LANGUAGE CO-EVOLVE?  
SIMILARITIES BETWEEN MUSIC AND LANGUAGE

Darwin believed language and music had a common origin in sexually selected mating calls, but that language developed first. However, today researchers believe the preponderance of evidence indicates language and music co-evolved from a common vocal ancestor adaptation.

Evidence indicates early hominid species could dance and sing several hundred thousand years before the appearance of modern Homospecies. Music, language, and dance may have a common origin in the modules that evolved for pounding, throwing, and tool-using generally. The underlying skill manifesting as an adaptation would have been rhythm.

Language syntax (order or arrangement) and musical syntax appear to share common processes in the brain. Studies of brain activity during music and language processing show similarities in the way the brain handles temporal (time-related) aspects of both language and music. "When we listen to language and music, not only do we expect words or chords with specific meaning and function, but we also expect them to be presented on time!" For hilarious confirmation, track down Bob and Ray's comedy sketch, "Slow Talkers of America."

Music could have evolved from speech, or speech from music, or, more likely, both speech and music could have co-evolved, sharing a common ancestor that had some characteristics of speech, some of music. In early humans, the music-language precursor, termed "musilanguage" by the neuroscientist Steven Brown, would have conveyed referential meaning (i.e., information) and also emotional meaning, using discrete pitch levels and expressive phrasing. Eventually, the musilanguage precursor would have split into two specialties:

- A specialty for conveying mainly referential meaning symbolically, (language), initially by expressive phrasing, and later using a vocabulary of words
- A specialty for conveying emotional meaning, mainly without symbolic meaning (music), via discrete pitch levels

Music and language likely co-evolved, and therefore interacted. So crossover occurred, as evidenced in songs with lyrics-"verbal song." Today, there's a continuum:

| Pure  
speech | Expressive  
speech | Rhythmic  
poetry  
(including  
rap) | Melody  
with  
lyrics | Non-verbal  
vocal  
music  
(e.g., scat  
singing) | Pure  
instru-  
mental  
music |

Music and language both evolved as systems to communicate meaning via sound organized in the dimension of time. They have in common:

- Metrical structure: strong and weak beats
    
- Melodic contour: rising and falling pitch
    
- Group structure: phrases within phrases
    
- Phrase duration
    
- Communication of emotion (although music dominates)
    

However there are some clear and important differences between music and language:

- Language conveys information as well as emotion. Music communicates emotion only.
- Everybody can easily create language competently (talk meaningfully), whereas not everybody can create music competently. It may well be that this difference stems from the fact that everybody gets constant practice in language in everyday communication, whereas, after infancy and after learning to talk, musical communication as a survival necessity falls off dramatically, and therefore into disuse.
- Language does not have an equivalent of the musical phenomenon of harmony. In harmony, two separate pitches are produced at the same time and the brain makes sense of the resulting sound. However, in speech, two separate words produced at the same time sound garbled. The brain cannot make sense of the resulting sound.

Overall, the similarities between music and language in the brain are striking, and outweigh the differences, indicating a common origin.

# 1.4.6  
DID MUSIC AND LANGUAGE CO-EVOLVE? EVIDENCE FROM STUDIES OF ANIMALS

Both music and language have extremely similar phrase-based hierarchical structures and other similarities-so many that it's highly unlikely they did not co-evolve.

The evidence indicates primate singing evolved several times independently (a phenomenon called convergence) from adaptive calls originally used to signal alarm or to advertise territorial claims. Ultimately, such calls evolved into music and language in various species of the Homo genus.

In today's great apes, for example, hoots and calls transmit information among groups about where individuals and sub-groups are hanging out, who's looking for a mate, and what the neighbourhood primatologists are up to. Physical movements such as stomping and shaking branches often accompany vocalizations. In our hominid ancestors, such actions may well have evolved into rhythmic motion, reinforcing vocal calls.

Primates other than humans have vocal communication systems that fit the description of the musilanguage precursor. For example:

- Both gibbons and chimpanzees make vocalizations that biologists consider to be "protomusical," that is, ancestral or early stage, the kind of vocalizations that our hominid ancestors probably made before their brains enlarged and human-like music and language became possible.
- Vocalizations of East African vervet monkeys convey both emotion and referential meaning.
- Mated pairs of gibbons "sing" duets.

To summarize, language requires a large brain, as does rhythmic, scale-based, harmonic human music. No other species has a brain-to-body-weight ratio as high as humans, and no other species has either music or language. With so much in common, it's likely music and language co-evolved from precursor animal calls.

# 1.4.7  
DID MUSIC AND LANGUAGE CO-EVOLVE? EVIDENCE FROM STUDIES OF CHILDREN

Competence in both language and music develop in all normal children spontaneously. No conscious effort necessary. No formal training.

Both music and language function in accordance with rule-based brain systems comprised of elemental units (words, pitches, intervals) that group into larger structures (musical and lyrical phrases, sentences, choruses).

Children learn both music and language without any conscious awareness of what they're doing. They effortlessly combine musical elements to create entirely original tunes. With equal ease, they learn words and combine them to create entirely original sentences.

In both cases, they don'trealize that they're applying combinatorial rules, already in their brains from birth, to word-vocabularies and pitch-vocabularies.

# 1.4.8  
Why Your "Modern" Brain Hasn't Changed IN 50,000 TO 100,000 YEARS

Darwinian evolution happens ssssslllllllloooooooooowwwwwwwllllllllyyyyyy. Human brain modules evolved during Palaeolithic times, when our ancestors were hunter-gatherers. Pinker: "The mind is organized into modules or mental organs, each with a specialized design...Their operation was shaped by natural selection to solve the problems of the hunting and gathering life led by our ancestors in most of our evolutionary history." These adaptations still influence our behaviour and often complicate our lives in an increasingly high-tech social environment. We humans disregard our Stone Age genetic inheritance at our peril.

Are humans still evolving by Darwinian natural selection? There is evidence we are:

- One genetic mutation that regulates brain size (MCPH1) arose 37,000 years ago, and has spread "rapidly" (by slow evolutionary standards).
- Another brain-size-regulating gene (ASPM) emerged in its modern form only about 5,800 years ago.

Still, the overall Darwinian evolutionary change in the short term (over the past few tens of thousands of years) cannot be great, because it takes such a long time for an important adaptation to become encoded in the genome of a species.

Suppose you were to jump into a time machine and zip back to the Stone Age. Say, 64,813 years back. You look around and what do you see? Why, a newborn Homo sapiens baby. Alas, she's orphaned and wailing, poor dear. You scoop her up, jump back into your time machine, and whip back to the present.

Now what do you do? Contact Marshal McDillon, of course. His cousin's family, the Donkersloots, agree to raise the Stone Age baby.

What's she like anyway, with her 64,813-year-old brain and body? She's no different from anybody alive today. She looks the same as any newborn in Dodge City. Or even Wichita. As she grows up, she'll learn language normally, play piano, hang around in malls, ride horses, have her pick of ardent male admirers, graduate from university, and become a psychology professor.

Evolutionary lag is the period of time it takes for a mutation in an individual that results in a significant survival or reproductive advantage to become encoded in the human genome. The interval is of the order of several hundred centuries-tens of thousands of years.

On the other hand, the selective pressure of local climatic conditions can bring on less significant adaptations over shorter time periods. For instance, variations in skin color (a topic discussed in Section 1.5).

# "INTELLIGENT" DESIGN? RUBBISH

Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. —ARTHUR C. CLARKE

I have...a foreboding of an America in my children's generation, or my grandchildren's generation ... when, clutching our crystals and nervously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in steep decline, unable to distinguish between what's true and what feels good, we slide, almost without noticing, into superstition and darkness. -CARL SAGAN

It's hard to know where to begin with the notion of "intelligent design" (usually abbreviated ID).

ID is a religious creation myth that goes like this: "Wow! How wonderfully complex the living world is! Must be the work of an intelligent designer! Couldn't possibly have occurred by unguided natural selection."

The concept of intelligent design is not remotely scientific. Not a single paper supporting the notion has ever passed peer review for publication in a scientific journal. Like all creation myths, there's simply no evidence for ID, and the hypothesis is untestable. ID is creationist movement funded, especially in the United States, by wealthy conservative Christians.

Use of the word "intelligent" in a term for a creation myth makes ID sound scientific. Strongholds of Christian fundamentalism, including many southern U. S. states, periodically succeed in mandating the teaching of creation mythology (usually dubbed "creation science") in public schools. However, the courts, recognizing the principle of separation of church and state, usually strike down such laws. Religious fundamentalists pull out all stops to out-manoeuver the courts by insisting that ID does not name God as the intelligent designer. It just implies that God is the intelligent designer. (Perhaps the time has come for Hindus and Buddhists to insist on the teaching of the "science" of reincarnation in the public school system!)

All religions invoke the supernatural without tangible, empirically verifiable evidence, and are hostile to scientific principles that challenge religious doctrine, such as hypothesis testing and critical thinking. Science is about nature and reality, not the supernatural and mythology, so scientific and religious beliefs often conflict.

Far from being "intelligently designed," anatomy reveals how creatures are cobbled together, sometimes even jury-rigged, exactly as predicted by blind Darwinian natural selection. A few examples:

- Humans (and other animals) have more miscarriages than live births.
- The retina of the human eye is "installed" backwards.
- The laryngeal nerve takes a ridiculous roundabout loop to get from the larynx to the brain.
- Human males have nipples.
- In human males, the urethra passes through the prostate. gland—probably the last place an intelligent designer would route it.

Humans like to try to solve difficult problems with binary classification. Often, this takes the form of a false dichotomy: "If you have no scientific evidence, then God is responsible." (This leaves out the possibility that a scientific explanation does exist, or will one day be found.)

Such is the flawed thinking behind intelligent design. Science does in fact have an extremely well-supported scientific explanation of complex design in nature, namely Darwinian natural selection. Richard Dawkins' The Blind Watchmaker is one of many books that spells out the scientific explanation in detail. Darwinian evolution by natural selection gave rise to all life on earth, including the human species. Without foresight, without consciousness, without purpose. And without any need for assistance from a deity or the supernatural.

Natural selection gave rise to the vast complexity and variety of organisms in nature. Richard Dawkins refers to the process of natural selection as the "blind watchmaker" because cumulative mutations over billions of years lead to vastly complex organisms, creating the illusion of design, without nature seeing, hearing, or otherwise "knowing" what's going on.

This applies to humans and especially the human brain. The process seems magical, but it isn't. Darwinian evolution created humans. Advances in knowledge about human biology are replacing notions of a separation of mind and brain.

## DARWINIAN EVOLUTION AND ADAPTATIONS (IncludING MUSIC)

I don't like nature. It's big plants eating little plants, small fish being eaten by big fish, big animals eating each other ... It's like an enormous restaurant. -WOODY ALLEN (Love and Death) Many consider Charles Darwin one of the three greatest scientists of all time, in the company of Newton and Einstein. Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace independently came up with the insight now called Darwinian evolution. Darwin wrote a number of landmark books identifying and describing natural selection, sexual selection, and other aspects of evolution.

Darwinian evolution is the most important theory in all of biology. Voluminous evidence from modern science shows that Darwin got it right, despite having no knowledge of DNA or genes. Darwin discovered that life evolves in distinct lines, with each species on its own individual twig of an ever-widening bush, each species descended from a common ancestor, but destined never to meet. (However, at the bacteria level some evidence indicates "gene-swapping" goes on between unrelated organisms.) Humans did not "descend from apes," and chimpanzees will never evolve into humans.

Darwin came under fierce attack for pointing out (correctly, it turns out) that humankind is merely one of millions of species that evolved from earlier life forms. Moreover, nothing creative or directional goes on in evolution. No ultimate goal

exists in the evolution of any species. Homo sapiens does not represent the culmination of anything and is not evolving towards anything.

It's an interesting paradox that humans, with dazzling cognition and insight about everything from Einsteinian relativity to genetics to artistic expression, are clearly unlike any other species on the planet-and yet humans evolved by exactly the same processes as all other species on the planet and carry the same genes as the humblest of them.

Darwinian evolution causes the emergence of adaptations such as bipedalism, music, and language in two ways: natural selection and sexual selection.

# 1. How Natural Selection Works

All living things compete to survive and pass on their genes. In a given species, each individual differs slightly from all the other individuals. Therefore, in the prevailing environmental conditions, the ability to survive and procreate varies from individual to individual. This variability means some individuals thrive better than others under the same environmental conditions. Those that do best-the winners in the evolutionary struggle for resources and opportunities to reproduce-are thus "naturally selected" to pass on their genes to the next generation. Those individuals that do not fare well in the same environment do not pass on their genes.

## 2. How Sexual Selection Works

Although some species do not reproduce sexually, most do. Members of species that reproduce sexually compete with each other to mate with individuals of the opposite sex. Individuals of both sexes vary in their attractiveness and availability as potential mates. This variability means some individuals are more successful than others in mating and procreating, and are thus "sexually selected" to pass on their genes. Those individuals that fail to mate do not pass on their genes.

Woody Allen's observation that the world is an enormous, chaotic restaurant is bang on. All animals, including humans, survive and evolve by eating plants or other animals or both. Species evolve defences to keep from getting eaten. Other species evolve ways to get around those defences, which triggers the evolution of more elaborate defences, and so on-an evolutionary arms race. "Nature, red in tooth and claw," as Tennyson put it.

# THE NATURALISTIC FALLACY

The naturalistic fallacy goes like this: whatever happens in the natural world, well, that's the way it ought to be.

The problem is, it doesn't follow logically that, just because something happens in nature, it's a Good Thing-that its moral value is somehow asserted. Belief that "natural = good" is called the naturalistic fallacy. This fallacy led to social Darwinism, discussed earlier.

Nature is utterly mindless and blindly indifferent. Heart defects are natural. So is cancer. So is malaria. Nature is by far the world's greatest bioterrorist.

We humans have "natural" inclinations to lash out violently against those we perceive as doing us harm. Fortunately, humans also have natural propensities for resolving conflict, helping each other, and overriding impulses that could hurt us in the long run. Our evolved moral sense enables us to get along with each other imore or lessi.

Scientists, lawyers, politicians and others spend their days finding ways to overcome or defeat the horrors of dog-eat-dog nature:

- Scientists try to come up with vaccines and medicines to counteract the effects of natural pathogens.
- Surgeons try to repair congenital heart problems and any number of other natural conditions.
- Politicians (in theory) pass laws to help us in our struggle to survive and to protect us from our natural impulses to harm or exploit each other; police forces try (in theory) to enforce those laws.
- Teachers pass on information that enables us to acquire what we need to survive.

Humans' evolved empathy and moral sense are adaptations that enable most of us to rise above utterly selfish, brutish behaviour. By behaving humanely, humans defy nature.

Non-human animals such as lions, eagles, and bears have no ethical sense, and behave with breathtaking selfishness, callousness, and savagery towards all but their immediate kin.

Normal human behaviour is saintly by comparison. Most people behave "humanely" most of the time, not just towards family and friends, but also towards perfect strangers and animals.

If humans had not evolved an ethical sense, Homo sapiens likely would have died out long ago. Constant warfare, natural pathogens, predators and other natural phenomena would have done in the human species by now. (Of course, darker human impulses of those with access to massive technology-based power may one day win out and lead to our quick extinction.)

Humans evolved the ultimate weapon in the evolutionary arms race: intelligence. We have the ability, through language, to share and pool survival-related information and pass it on to future generations through culture. This has allowed humans to get around most defences of most other organisms (although microorganisms still kill millions of our species). We can kill predators such as lions and bears that would easily be able to kill us if we did not have the intelligence to make and use weapons.

For Darwinian evolution by natural selection or sexual selection to proceed, several conditions must obtain:

1. Selection. Selective pressure must exist. Species evolve to fit imposed environmental conditions (differential fitness, or survival of the fittest).
2. Variation. Genetic variability must exist. Chance mutations and errors in gene replication cause genetic variability to be present among the individuals of a population.
3. Heredity. Replication must occur in order to pass on genetic mutations to future generations.

The replicating entities are genes. Living things do not replicate. Only their genes replicate through their offspring.

Inherited traits that enhance the ability of future replicating entities to replicate are the adaptations. For an adaptation such as music to continue in future generations, it must confer either naturally-selected survival benefits or sexuallyselected reproductive benefits (or both). Music probably confers survival benefits in infancy and reproductive benefits later in life.

## DAWKINS' "SELFISH GENE": GENE'S-EYE VIEW OF EVOLUTION

...the fundamental unit of selection, and therefore of self-interest, is not the species, nor the group, nor even, strictly, the individual. It is the gene, the unit of heredity. -RICHARD DAWKINS E. O. Wilson pointed out decades ago that evolution is really all about gene preservation and replication. This "gene's-eye view" of natural and sexual selection is usually referred to as "selfish gene" theory, after the book, The Selfish Gene, by the British zoologist, Richard Dawkins. Selfish gene theory has become the dominant framework used in explaining adaptations and adaptive behaviour in evolutionary biology and psychology. "Selfish gene" metaphorically explains how genes become successful by behaving in a pitiless, "selfish" way. Of course genes don't "think" and "act"-they're blind, deaf, mute chemicals that build living organisms. If the organism dies before the gene it hosts successfully replicates, the gene fails. If the organism lives long enough to replicate, then the gene it hosts succeeds in continuing on to another generation. Genes, then-not bodies-are the actual units of biological selection and replication. The individuals that genes construct (plants, animals, bacteria, etc.) serve only as vehicles to pass on genes.

Genes create adaptations-units of biological function that have survival or reproductive benefits for the individual. Adaptations such as music and language actually benefit the gene, because the gene replicates, not the body. In that sense, genes behave "selfishly." But that does not necessarily mean the organisms the genes create behave utterly selfishly. It's often to the advantage of genes to select for unselfishness as a behavioural trait in the organisms they build. For example:

- Parents behave unselfishly towards their own children, who carry their parents' genes.
- Children benefit from their parents' caring, nurturing, unselfish behaviour by surviving to reproductive age, still carrying their parents' genes.
- Those children pass on their parents' genes to yet another generation.

Organisms eventually die, but the genes they once carried keep replicating. Most humans and all non-human animals have no idea that genes made them, and that if they have offspring, they will have successfully served as vehicles for gene replication. It's important to keep in mind that genes are not living things. They are just

strands of DNA-a decidedly non-living molecule. Humans are neither cold, calculating "gene machines" nor "blank slates," programmed by the social environment.

In the discussions coming up about why music evolved in humans, keep in mind how adaptations evolve in light of selfish gene theory. Genes build adaptations of the body and brain that enable humans to successfully survive, reproduce, and pass on copies of ... genes.

# 1.5.3  
Hootin' and Howlin' ReVisited: Sound as a Signalling Device in Animals

Why did animals evolve the use of sound in the first place? As a signalling device for warning and for mate-attraction. To be a successful adaptation, the signal must not only benefit the individual(s) being signalled; it must also benefit the signaller (selfish genes at work).

- A signal used as a threat warns a competitor to back off, or face a potentially injurious (or lethal) fight.
- A signal use as a warning advises close kin (carrying the signaller's genes) of a nearby predator.
- A contact signal keeps a group together; safety in numbers.
- A courtship signal in humans takes the form of a display of musical ability, signalling mental fitness.

Animals use other signalling devices as well: smell and sight. But sound has several advantages:

- Sound works when the signaller and receiver are far apart, even though they can see each other.
- Sound works when the signaller and receiver cannot see each other because it's too dark or because objects such as bushes or rocks stand between them.
- Sound can carry messages that vary with the signaller's call.

Our Homo sapiens ancestors, with incredibly effective sound-based signalling and communication adaptations we call music and language, out-survived all other hominid species. Evolutionary biologists, psychologists, anthropologists, and musicologists have come up with several well-supported hypotheses about selective pressures that gave rise to the human adaptation for music. These explanations do not mutually exclude each other. Following are some of the main ones.

# 1.5.4  
MUSIC AS AN ADAPTATION FOR MOTHER-INFANT COMMUNICATION: WE'RE ALL "PREEMIES" AT BIRTH

Selective pressure for group living favoured a large brain size (encephalation) and also two-legged walking and running (bipedalism). In hominid females, bipedalism narrowed the birth canal substantially. This placed an upper limit on the size of a newborn's head that could squeeze through the birth canal.

It also place an upper limit on gestation length. In the human species, babies are actually born significantly prematurely. We're all "preemies." As a result, at birth, human babies are completely helpless, and remain so for a significant length of time.

Meanwhile, if a pre-lingual human infant has any hope of surviving, it needs some way to continually communicate its many and constant needs with its mother. And the mother needs a way of knowing for certain that she is meeting those needs successfully. Since newborns do not have language, meaningful mother-infant communication must take other forms.

### 1.5.5  
MUSIC AS AN ADAPTATION FOR MOTHER-INFANT COMMUNICATION: "MOTHERESE"

According to the mother-infant communication hypothesis of the distinguished scholar Ellen Dissanayake, selective pressure gave rise to music as a vocal and rhythmic communication and coordination system between mothers and pre-lingual infants. This enabled better maternal care over a longer period of time, and better survival rates of infants into childhood and adulthood.

Pre-lingual infants have and use musical abilities at birth. So do handicapped children and adults born without any capacity to learn language.

Worldwide, mothers vocalize with their infants in a particular, distinctive style called "motherese." Mothers do not learn motherese culturally-they're born with it, evidence that selective pressure evolved the brain circuitry to do this.

Motherese has a number of clearly musical characteristics:

- Melodic (variably pitched)
- Repetitive
- Grouped in phrases of 3 to 4 seconds, like the phrase groupings of poetry and music found in every culture.

As well, mothers communicate with infants via rhythmic, rocking motions, possibly a precursor to dancing. Both vocalization and rocking, rhythmic motions are hallmarks of music as a temporal art.

# MYTH OF THE "MOZART EFFECT"

"Listening to Mozart makes you smarter," was the claim. The "Mozart effect" became a fad.

The governors of a couple of American states requested the issuing of Mozart CDs to all new mothers. One entrepreneur cashed in on the craze with a book and series of recordings.

It started in the early 90's when a team of researchers published findings that indicated spatial and temporal abilities improved in subjects after passive exposure to music composed by Mozart. Other researchers could not replicate the findings. Further research found that the so-called Mozart effect had nothing to do with Mozart's music, but could be replicated with any stimulus of the subject's preference ie.g., a narrated story, or some other musici.

However, if a child begins creating and learning music actively at a young age, the brain responds by allocating more neural matter to musical processing than the child would have if he or she did not actively study and learn music. As well, research indicates that children from inner-city backgrounds who get ongoing, long-term musical instruction through projects such as MusicLink ([www.musiclink.com/academy.cam](http://www.musiclink.com/academy.cam)) do much better than their disadvantaged circumstances would otherwise predict.

Initially, an infant, being a preemie, has little capacity to respond to motherese. After a couple of months, the infant begins to vocalize positively, smile, and respond positively to rhythmic interaction. A mother-infant feedback loop of emotional communication develops.

Infant-to-mother emotional communication via musical code sends messages of hunger, frustration, distress. And also positive communication: contentment, happiness. Mothers know how to decode the messages, and also how to communicate back to the infant in the same non-verbal, emotional, musical way. This two-way non-verbal communication strongly reinforces mother-infant bonding.

Neither infant nor mother need to learn how to communicate emotionally with each other using this "musical" system. It's inborn in both.

The presence of the infant probably changes the mother's emotional state. Motherese successfully engages the attention of the infant, which begins to respond after several weeks and provides the mother with vital feedback on the infant's survival needs.

Mothers in every culture communicate to their pre-lingual babies in the same specific way: raised pitch level, distinctive pitch contours, repetitive patterns, rhythmic patterns. These elements differ markedly from normal adult-to-adult conversation.

In all cultures:

- Mothers communicate with infants using motherese, and, after a couple of months, infants use the same mechanism to communicate back.
- Infants can mimic their mothers' singing-pitch and melodic contour-early in life, as young as two months of age.
- Infants pay more attention to female vocalizing than to male vocalizing.
- Infants respond more attentively when mothers sing than when mothers speak.
- The lullaby as a mother-to-infant song form takes on the same characteristics.
- Songs for infants and small children constitute a distinct genre of music.

Taken together, all of these characteristics suggest that maternal singing is adaptive. The origin of the music-emotion linkage in adult humans could well be motherese, the music of mother-infant emotional communication of the infant's survival state.

# INSTINCTIVE SMILING AND LAUGHING

Babies who are born both deaf and blind begin smiling at the same period of their development as babies born with normal hearing and sight. A blind infant would not smile imake a facial signal that communicates happiness or contentment to the motherl if smiling were not inborn.

Later in life humans continue to communicate happiness to others by smiling and laughing. Humans laugh 30 times more often in the company of other people than when alone.

Laughter is involuntary, indicating its adaptive nature. And, like other expressions of emotion, laughter is contagious.

In adult humans, competently composed music triggers emotion. Since emotional circuits are essential for survival, people find themselves drawn to music that evokes strong emotions. (Chapter 9 goes into some detail on music and emotion.)

Most songwriters have no clue how to create memorable music because musical notes, unlike the words of a language, have no referential meaning.

Most popular music takes the form of songs with words instead of purely instrumental music. It's likely that songwriters, aware to some extent of their inability (due to lack of knowledge) to create emotionally powerful instrumental music, rely on lyrics to help deliver some kind of emotional punch. Songwriters have a better intuitive grasp of the emotional information words carry than they have of the emotional information musical elements such as intervals carry.

### 1.5.6  
MUSIC AS AN ADAPTATION FOR SOCIAL BONDING: SURVIVAL THROUGH COOPERATION

Music, perhaps, provides a unique mnemonic framework within which humans can express, by the temporal organization of sound and gesture, the structure of their knowledge and of social relations. Songs and rhythmically organized poems and sayings form the major repository of knowledge in non-literate cultures. This seems to be because such organized sequences are much easier to remember than the type of prose which literate societies use in books. -JOHN SLOBODA

To transfer knowledge across generations, you need human societies. But to get to the point of having human societies, you need group bonding and socialization. That's why music, dance, and language had to predate the formation of cohesive societies, which only emerged in the past few thousand years.

Language and music make it possible for individuals to bond into large, cooperative groups. Extensive research findings strongly indicate music promotes and coordinates group bonding, cooperation, and social cohesion:

- Everybody's a performer. In most hunter-gatherer societies, everyone participates in music-no one's an audience member. As well, dancing nearly always accompanies music making.
- Group emotional arousal. Music causes a state of general emotional arousal in all the members of a group simultaneously. So music has always served well in situations involving more than one person and ritual: marriages, funerals, groups marching, religious ceremonies.
- Solidarity through emotional synchrony. Being able to keep a steady beat and sing to it would increase evolutionary fitness by enabling larger and larger social groups to participate as a single, coordinated entity, increasing solidarity and camaraderie through emotional synchrony. Music has the effect of imposing order and structure on time. At an event featuring music, everyone experiences the same feeling at the same time. Some examples in various cultures today:
- Crowd singing at popular music concerts
- Congregational hymn singing
- Singing of solidarity songs on picket lines
- Karaoke singing
- "Happy Birthday," sung at social gatherings millions of times a year
- Campfire singing (except by outlaws on the lam)
- National anthem singing
- Crowd singing at sports events such as British football matches and ice hockey games

# THE EQUESTRIAN SPORT OF ICE HOCKEY

Spectators at professional ice hockey games heartily sing the national anthem at the outset of every game. And throughout the game, they sing various 'fight' songs to encourage the home team.

If you live in a tropical country such as Brazil or Nigeria, you may not have heard of the sport of ice hockey. It's a team sport played in northern countries such as Canada and Sweden. Ice hockey resembles the game of polo, except that it's played on a large ice surface called a "hockey rink." The players' horses are fitted with "skates"-long sharp blades welded to the bottoms of the horses' iron shoes. The horses are specially trained to skate rapidly and gracefully around the hockey rink.

Each team has six riders: three forwards, two defense riders, and one goalkeeper. Instead of a long-handled polo mallet, each rider carries a long wooden stick with a blade at the end, called a "hockey stick." The object of the game is to bat a small rubber disk, called a "puck" into the other team's net, scoring a goal.

In ice hockey, riders frequently jostle each other (called "body checking"), causing players to fall from their horses. Often, the fall kills the player outright because the ice surface is rock hard. A player who survives a fall frequently does not make it off the rink fast enough and falls victim to thousands of pounds of horseflesh skating over him or her.

The average professional ice hockey player earns several million dollars a year. But the average playing career doesn't last more than a year or two, due to injury or death.

The rock group, The Doors, wrote and recorded a now-classic song about the equestrian sport of ice hockey, called "Riders On The Storm."

Popular music charts also reflect group participation in music. When not listening to the same hit songs en masse at concerts, people listen to the same songs at the same time on radio, television, webcasts, etc. Masses of young people purchase the same songs during the time those songs ride high on the charts. Rather than listen to a recording, people tend to prefer to go out and get a fix of the same music performed live-to experience the primal pleasure of identifying with, and entraining with, the musicians (and dancers). It's akin to the pleasure of watching professional athletes.

Our savannah-dwelling hominid ancestors walked on two feet but did not stand tall, and had no claws or fangs. Easy meals for lethal predators. So, to protect themselves against strong, fast predators, and to successfully hunt game, hominids had to become sophisticated in group-living and cooperation. Human beings use each other as tools in the survival game. Naturally-selected traits arise in response to environmental pressure, which includes ourselves. Hundreds of thousands of years ago, our fellow humans were an integral part of our environment, just as they are

today. So we have evolved many brain adaptations that enable us to interact successfully with each other.

The expansion and evolution of human social structure drove the evolution of many mental tools for social behaviour (such as music and language). The cerebral cortex and the skull, therefore, kept getting bigger and bigger: encephalation. Humans have an encephalation factor of 7 , meaning our brains are 7 times larger than would be expected for an animal of our size. Dolphins and porpoises are next, at 4 to 5 , with chimpanzees and gorillas at 2.5 . The one thing that animals with high encephalation factors have in common is that they're all highly social.

# 1.5.7  
MUSIC AS AN ADAPTATION FOR SOCIAL BONDING: EVIDENCE FROM STUDIES OF CHILDREN AND ANIMALS

Usually, people make music in groups. Children show a pronounced drive to repeat sound elements in rhythmic synchrony. This ensures involvement and belonging with the group. (The same applies to conversation. One of the major ties that binds humans in groups is plain, ordinary talking.)

Both music and language probably have a common origin in long sequences of primate vocalizations in which individuals tried to repeat or match each other's calls. These became formulaic phrases. You can hear echos of this phenomenon in the song-like patter of auctioneers, or in universal children's chants such as "Ring Around The Rosie":

||na|||
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|na|na||naaa|
||na||naaa|

Early hominid vocal music would have consisted of chorusing (and, later, drumming accompaniment). Various animal species exhibit chorusing and duetting:

- Gibbons do a lot of duetting, mainly in mated pairs. Gibbon songs show clear coordination.
    
- Chimpanzees have distinctive pant-hoot calls, but don't show much coordinated vocalizing. When an individual launches into a pant-hoot, another will sometimes respond.
    
- Gelada baboons, like humans, sometimes find themselves in socially stressful situations that result in conflict. They spend large amounts of time and energy engaging in friendly vocalizing ("vocal grooming") in order to cultivate and continue relationships. This tends to dispel conflict to some degree.
    
- Birds sing in groups (the dawn chorus, for example), but their singing is not coordinated or synchronized the way human group singing is. The exception is duetting. Male and female songbirds of many species, especially tropical birds, sing in duets. These monogamous pair-bonded birds sing to advertise their claim to a territory, and possibly to maintain their monogamous relationship.
    

# 1.5.8  
MUSIC AS AN ADAPTATION FOR SOCIAL BONDING: Grooming, TROOP SIZE, AND Dunbar's NUMBER

Primates and other animals often live in groups or "troops" for protection against predators. As social groupings increase in size and complexity, competitors within the aggregation turn on each other. So cliques form for intra-group protection.

The hypothesis of British anthropologist and evolutionary biologist Robin Dunbar is that, in primates other than humans, alliances hold together because members groom each other. Not because everybody in the group is bug-infested. Because grooming feels good. (Same reason humans like massages.)

Those who groom each other also defend each other when conflicts arise. Grooming takes a lot of time and energy, so primate troops that physically groom each other can't grow beyond a certain size, 50 individuals, tops.

Humans, on the other hand, given sufficient social pressure, can track as many as 150 individuals socially (widely known in anthropology as Dunbar's number, after Dunbar's calculations, based on much evidence). So the question is, how come humans can keep track of so many more fellow humans than, say, chimps can of fellow chimps?

According to Dunbar, because language evolved as a substitute for physical grooming. Language enables maintenance of contacts and friendships among many more individuals than would be possible by physical grooming. But it takes a lot of brain power to keep track of so many social relationships. So natural selection came up with some sophisticated brain-based adaptations, especially language. In the grooming-substitute hypothesis, the large human cortex evolved in response to the selective pressure of ever-increasing "symbolic grooming" (language and related adaptations). As other researchers have pointed out, this would especially apply to

child rearing in culturally complex environments, and would include the evolution of music.

Language and music probably have a common origin, as discussed previously. If selective pressure of ever-increasing social structure and complexity drove encephalation, then language and music were probably the main specific adaptations, language for symbolic (referential) communication, music for emotional communication.

Even language has its limits with respect to social interaction. Typically, if four or fewer people are engaged in a conversation, all may participate meaningfully. However, once the group grows to five or six or more, it splits into separate smaller conversational sub-groupings-even though all five or six individuals are physically close together.

This may help explain why popular music groups tend to lose cohesion, musically and socially, as membership increases beyond three or four musicians.

# 1.5.9

## MUSIC AS AN ADAPTATION FOR SOCIAL BONDING: COALITION SIGNALLING

Vervet monkeys produce calls that communicate both referential and emotional meaning. These calls warn their kin of an approaching predator (emotional meaning-fear). Each type of call specifies a different type of predator (referential meaning-snake, eagle, etc.). The vervets react to each type of call with a different escape pattern, depending on the predator indicated in the call.

In humans and in non-human animals, the auditory system connects directly to regions of the brain that control muscles. If you hear something unusual, your body can automatically react quickly. When somebody sneaks up behind you and yells "Boo!", you jump instantly, without a moment's thought.

Music and motor control also go together, as evidenced in dancing, clapping along to a beat, head nodding, and so on. How might our rhythmic and entrainment skills have arisen?

Possibly through coalition signalling. As selfish gene theory predicts, we humans, like other animals, tend to favour those who carry our genes or those whose genes we carry-our close kin, in other words. Especially our progeny. But humans also have the unique ability to form many friendships and alliances with individuals in whom we have no kinship investment whatever. Coalitions.

Music may have evolved as a mechanism to synchronize the mood of all the members of a coalition, to prepare everybody, regardless of kinship status, to act as

a group. Motor activities that have a strong rhythmic aspect, such as walking and running, may have become ritualized in body movements such as group dancing.

The biologists Edward Hagan and Gregory Bryant have provided experimental evidence supporting the hypothesis that music and dancing in groups evolved initially as a coalition signalling system-a way of communicating to others the competence or "quality" of a group. Coalition signalling would likely have evolved from territorial defence signalling, common in other primates.

Coordinated emotional expression of a group amplifies coordinated action. Groups that can successfully demonstrate coordinated solidarity show strength and intimidate would-be attackers. This is why riot police form into coordinated phalanxes, march rhythmically, and beat their shields in time.

Before language evolved, our increasingly social hominid ancestors would have needed some mechanism of identifying, among non-kin, whether all or some of an aggregation of other individuals actually constituted a group, a clique with a purpose. Coalition signalling would help explain the origin of human abilities to identify and evaluate the membership and purpose of a group, and whether or not it would be mutually beneficial to become a member.

# 1.5.10

## MUSIC AS AN ADAPTATION SHAPED BY SEXUAL SELECTION: SEX DIFFERENCES AND THE INNATE TABOO

People looking to justify socially unacceptable behaviour sometimes cite evolutionary theory on the biological differences between men and women. "Your honour, my client's genetic inheritance as a male human compelled him to get roarin' drunk and commit armed robberies to get money to buy a guitar so that he could impress his sweetheart with his original songs about good-hearted women in love with good-timin' men. So all charges oughta be dropped."

Evolutionary theory does not provide justifications or excuses. Only explanations. Nature has nothing to do with good or evil; it unfolds with utter indifference. Anyone of either sex has the ability to override natural propensities, as discussed earlier. Humans have free will.

Both males and females have music and language capabilities, but this is not the case for all traits. Arnold Schwarzenegger and all other men carry genes for a uterus, but these genes don't express themselves in males.

Yet, if males and females have the same musical capabilities, why are there so many more male musicians than female musicians in every society globally? How could sex differences be implicated?

For many people, even broaching the subject of sex-based behavioural propensities constitutes a strict taboo. If tangible, empirically verifiable evidence indicates something is true and significant, then declaring the subject off limits for discussion, instead of dealing with reality, amounts to odious Talibanism.

No place for that taboo here. The next few sections discuss sexual selection and music.

# THE HILLARY CLINTON PHILANDERING GENE RESEARCH FOUNDATION

Thanks to common descent, humans share many of the same genes with numerous other animals. Maybe that's why some animals exhibit human-like behaviour.

Such as philandering. Take the humble vole, a tiny furry mouse-like critter. In one species, the meadow vole, the male gets around like Screamin' Jay Hawkins (reported to have fathered some 75 children). But the male of a closely-related species, the prairie vole, typically settles down with one good woman for life. Just like in certain wholesome country songs where things turn out better than they do in certain George Jones songs.

Scientists in Atlanta decided to see what would happen if they transferred a specific gene, suspected to influence philandering behaviour, from the prairie vole to the meadow vole. Sure enough, the investigators found that, by manipulating the expression of a single gene, they could make promiscuous male meadow voles behave like faithful prairie voles.

Since humans have the same gene, could a similar injection be developed to change the philandering behaviour of human males? Send your donation to the Hillary Clinton Philandering Gene Research Foundation..

MUSIC AS AN ADAPTATION SHAPED BY SEXUAL SELECTION: SEX DIFFERENCES VS RACE DIFFERENCES

And another thing. Those who would damn any discussion of sex-based behavioural differences also tend to discourage and discredit such discussion by equating it with advocacy of race-based behavioural differences-for which no credible evidence exists. The clear implication is that, if you're going to give credence to sex-based differences, then you'll also give credence to race-based differences. And who knows what else. So you're promoting sexism and racism. So goes the smear.

The truth is, sex differences that affect behaviour have been a fact of life in all mammal species for more than 200 million years. In humans, strong evidence indicates evolved sex differences apply as much to the brain and behaviour as to anatomy and functioning from the neck down.

Unlike sex, the concept of "race" has no social value. It poisons social relations. The races humans identify today do not differ significantly from each other genetically. Unlike the sexes, not a single race, however defined (which isn't clear), is represented in significant numbers in every culture globally. There is no "race" gene.

DNA and human genome studies indicate all humans are descended from a small group that left Africa perhaps 100,000 years ago. All of our ancestors had dark skin. All of today's so-called races, from blue-eyed blond Scandinavians to Australian aborigines are descended from that one small group of Africans.

Not nearly enough time has elapsed for meaningful adaptations to have occurred that would differentiate one "racial" group from another with respect to mental functioning. Selective pressure that leads to behaviour-modifying adaptations has nothing to do with skin color.

Obviously some adaptations in humans have occurred in the past 100,000 years in response to selective pressure. These adaptations show up in traits such as eye color, skin color, facial features, etc. Superficial features of this nature-variable characteristics of external body parts-reflect selective pressure to adapt to conditions of regional physical environments.

Clearly, the highly visible traits that identify racial differences, which neo-Nazis and other such loonies try to spin into "scientific proof" of their nonsensical doctrines, have nothing to do with "superiority" or "inferiority" of human intelligence or character.

In any case, so much intermarriage takes place across racial boundaries that the concept of "racial purity" has little meaning. For example, research indicates some 30%30% of African Americans have at least one "white" ancestor.

For that matter, you only need to go back a little more than 30 generations (about 700 years, at 20 years per generation) before you discover that the number of your

ancestors exceeds today's global population. In other words, literally everybody alive today is related to everybody else.

# IN THE BLOOD? NOT BLOODY LIKELY

The age-old mistaken belief that human blood possesses some special power beyond its biological function has not faded away, even in countries with high educational standards.

## "Bloodline"

The concept of "bloodline"-holy bloodline, ancestral bloodline-has no basis in reality. Heredity has nothing to do with blood. It's all about genes.

At the level of DNA, every generation gets "diluted" by a factor of one-half. You have only 50%50% of the DNA of each of your parents, 25%25% of the DNA of each of your grandparents, and so on. If you could trace your family roots back, say, 200 years (10 generations), you would find that the contribution to your genetic make-up by any of your ancestors from only 10 generations back would amount to a less than 1/101/10 th of 1%1%. So much for claims about the significance of "royal bloodlines" in the world's monarchies.

## Blood Type

Millions of people in Asia believe that blood type affects human behaviour. Believers even make important life decisions based on the "psychology" of blood type, such as deciding whom to befriend, hire, or date. There is no scientific evidence whatsoever supporting the daft notion of "blood type personalities."

In countries such as Japan and South Korea, blood type believers who consider themselves to have "acceptable" blood types abuse and discriminate against those who have "unacceptable" blood types. The irrationality and harm of such discrimination ranks with that of racism, sexism, homophobia, and xenophobia.

There is evidence that fear of people who don't look like us has an evolutionary basis. In Palaeolithic times, our hominid ancestors, living in large groups for survival purposes, perceived outsiders as threatening. They probably were. Research findings

indicate modern humans appear to have retained this inclination of distrust and fear. The evidence points to a biologically-based propensity in all humans to discriminate against those "not like us" by virtue of everything from skin color to sexual orientation to religion. However, as discussed earlier, humans have the ability to override such instincts, and many of us do, at least some of the time.

Now, continuing with music and sex differences...

## MUSIC AS AN ADAPTATION SHAPED BY SEXUAL SELECTION: EVIDENCE FROM STUDIES OF ANIMALS

Darwin noted that in many species of birds and mammals, males vocalize ("sing") and females don't-or not nearly as much. Moreover, male vocalization occurs mainly in breeding season. The best singers have the best mating success. This is a form of sexual selection. The same sexual selective pressure gave rise to the capacity for music in humans.

There are more than 9,000 species of birds, of which about 4,000 sing. In birds, songs evolved to attract mates or to repel rivals for mates. Sexual selection in birds results in females choosing males with the most elaborate and varied repertoires of songs. Once the female and male have set up house, the male stops singing (sadly). Unless, for some reason, the male loses his mate. Then he goes nuts with singing again (hurrah!).

Male humpback whales sing competitively to attract females. Humpback whales even seem to improvise, like jazz musicians. They sing extended pieces lasting up to half an hour, anytime female humpbacks are in the neighbourhood-not only during mating season.

To be a sexually selected adaptation, music would have to confer reproductive benefits. According to the sexual selection hypothesis, music arose as a courtship display, evident in birdsong, for example. Most animals only ever produce calls during breeding season: birds, frogs, toads, insects, and many other species. And it's almost always males vocalizing to attract females.

Synchronous chorusing (which is not the same as entrainment) in non-human animals may have been the precursor to human entrainment ability. Male synchronous chorusing during mating season is found in some species of frogs and insects. It's automatic and requires no cooperation among individuals. Human synchronous music-making, by contrast, is deliberate and requires true cooperation.

Isometric time-keeping and entrainment may have evolved for the same reason as music-making evolved in other species-to attract mates. Rhythmic singing and dancing would facilitate sexual selection: males display and females choose. The most

co-ordinated and talented vocalists and dancers would become targets of female selection.

The capacity to do music originated with primitive calls in early hominids and evolved to the point where, today, people in all cultures create extraordinarily sophisticated music. This mode of evolutionary adaptation indicates a sexually selected arms race between, as the evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller puts it, "unfulfillable sexual demands and irresistible sexual displays." The great British geneticist and statistician, R. A. Fisher, developed the theory of "runaway sexual selection" to describe how this happens. He cited the peacock's fan as a classic example. It's a flashy trait that signals a high-functioning male.

- Peacocks display big showy tails and peahens select the peacock with the biggest, showiest tail to mate with. The peacock's tail indicates the male's more-than-adequate survival resources, and, therefore, reproductive fitness.
- Their offspring have genes that ensure continuance of the process, creating a positive-feedback loop. (NOTE: Both sexes carry the "big showy tail" trait, but the trait is only expressed in males.)
- Eventually, the peacock's tail becomes a handicap instead of a benefit, and the loop gets interrupted.

In humans, musicianship requires a large, highly-functioning brain. Males who display musical skills signal to females that the signaller would make a high quality mate, a mate with a comparatively creative, high-functioning brain. A mate who could make life creative and interesting year after year. Experimental evidence on music preferences indicates that women prefer men who have the ability to surprise them with new songs-to keep them from getting bored with the same old tune. Homo sapiens is a neophilic species: we just love novelty. It's what fuels the entertainment industry.

Today, in humans, the most common theme of songs is romantic love. Geoffrey Miller, one of today's leading champions of Darwin's sexual selection theory as the primary driver of the evolution of music in humans, notes that:

As a tool for activating specific conceptual thoughts in other people's heads, music is very bad and language is very good. As a tool for activating certain emotional states, however, music is much better than language. Combining the two in lyrical music such as love songs is best of all as a courtship display.

Musical productivity in males drops off significantly after marriage. Only about 3%3% of mammals are monogamous (compared with 90%90% of birds). In mammal species that are monogamous, empirical evidence indicates that vocal duetting serves to strengthen pair-bonds. Female gibbons, for example, produce

"great calls," to which male gibbons then respond. Male and female bonobos also sing, and are monogamous.

Moreover, the various monogamous primate species that duet are not closely related biologically, which means duetting and monogamy evolved several times, independently (convergence). This indicates that male-female duetting and monogamy go hand and hand. Isn't that sweet? If you want to keep your spouse around, all you have to do is duet with him or her. Like Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash. Or Tammy Wynette and George Jones (oops!).

# "GOODBYE TO LOVE": THE BONOBO'S SONG

In the evolutionary arms race, the human brain has become the ultimate weapon. Humans can and do use cognitive powers to smash the defences of practically all species, which cannot evolve counter-defences against humans fast enough. Consequently, wherever humans show up, species become extinct.

So it is, alas, with the peace-loving bonobo, also known as the pygmy chimp, or jungle hippie. Wild bonobos live only in the Congo. When conflict arises within a group of bonobos, they react by having sex. Lots and lots of sex, including non-vanilla sex. They're famous for it. Unlike chimpanzees, bonobos almost never fight or kill. All they seek is peace, love (i.e., sex), and happiness.

Humans routinely hunt bonobos and eat them. Bushmeat. Today, the bonobo population has dwindled to a mere few thousand in the wild (from perhaps 100,000 in 1980). If humans succeed in wiping out the bonobo, the jungle hippie will have the distinction of being the first great ape to suffer the fate of the passenger pigeon.

MUSIC AS AN ADAPTATION SHAPED BY SEXUAL SELECTION: DIFFERENCES IN MALE-FEMALE COGNITIVE SPECIALIZATIONS

Over millions of years of evolution, male and female hominids have experienced different selective pressures, resulting in sex differences in behaviour, interests, and preferences.

Although men and women are equally intelligent, male and female brains are wired differently. Males and females are also on different drugs, males on androgens and females on estrogens.

Empirical evidence of male-female cognitive differences contradicts the dogma that cultural and social influences account for all differences in behaviour, skills, and predispositions by sex. Contrary to wishful thinking and political correctness, differences in male-female preferences are hardwired from day one of life. For example, the stereotype that small boys prefer to play with trucks and mechanical objects whereas small girls prefer to play with dolls happens to be true. The great majority of female children, given the choice, select dolls over trucks; male children select trucks-long before they even know what sex they are.

This also occurs in our close primate relatives. For example, young vervet monkeys have no concept of "boy-appropriate" or "girl-appropriate" toys. Yet, given a selection of toys, they show the same stereotypical differences in preferred toy choice by sex as human children show.

Some well-documented evolved human female predispositions, skills, and interests include:

- Verbal communication
- Non-verbal communication (e. g., facial expression)
- Empathizing
- People-reading and social interaction
- Identification of objects
- Interest in habitat
- Nurturing
- Mathematical calculation
- Indirect, relational aggression

Evolved human male predispositions, skills, and interests include:

- Tracking moving objects
    
- Spatial cognition
    
- Devising systems ("systemizing")
    
- Risk-taking
    
- Competitiveness and status-seeking
    
- Figuring out how objects and events work
    
- Mathematical reasoning
    
- Con games and theft
    
- Direct, physical aggression
    

This does not mean, "All men are more competitive than all women." It does not mean, "All women are better at verbal communication than all men."

It means that:

- If you were to select one of the above traits, such as, say, "risk-taking," and
- If you were to find a quantifiable variable that would provide evidence about risk-taking by sex, such as, say, "number of race car drivers," and collect the data,
- Then the theory would predict you would likely find a difference in the number of race car drivers by sex, namely, significantly more males than females; and
- The theory would also predict that, because of the sex-specific, genetic basis for risk-taking behaviour, you would find the same pattern when measuring "number of race car drivers," everywhere in the world, regardless of country or culture. In other words, evidence that males have evolved brain circuitry that inclines them towards risk-taking behaviour.

The theory would predict similar findings on measures of any of the above-listed sex-based traits (and many more). For example, to measure the trait, "aggression," by sex, you could compare proportions of male and female prisoners incarcerated for violent crimes. If the theory has predictive value, you would find a much higher proportion of males doing prison time for violent crime (and, as it turns out, males in their late teens and twenties), again, regardless of nation or culture. (Interestingly, once pair-bonded, male criminal activity drops sharply.)

# "MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A NATURAL MAN"

Here are some personal ads ifound floating around on the internet), supposedly from the Dublin News. Each ad has the potential to inspire at least one good country song lyric.

- Heavy drinker, 35, Cork Area. Seeks gorgeous sex addict interested in a man who loves his pints, cigarettes, Glasgow Celtic Football Club and has been known to start fights on Patrick Street at three o'clock in the morning.
- Bitter, disillusioned Dublin man, lately rejected by longtime fiancee, seeks decent, honest, reliable woman, if such a thing still exists in this cruel world of hatchet-faced bitches.
- Ginger haired Galway man, a troublemaker, gets slit-eyed and shitty after a few scoops, seeks attractive, wealthy lady for bail purposes, maybe more.
- Bad tempered, foul-mouthed old bastard, living in a damp cottage in the ass end of Roscommon, seeks attractive 21 year old blonde lady, with a lovely chest.
- Limerick man, 27, medium build, brown hair, blue eyes, seeks alibi for the night of February 27 between 8 PM and 11:30 PM.
- Optimistic Mayo man, 35, seeks a blonde 20 year old double-jointed super model, who owns her own brewery, and has an open-minded twin sister.

A couple of sex-based inborn traits may partly explain the overwhelming male preoccupation with music (discussed in the next section).

- Males have a particular interest in, and propensity for, tracking moving things. Music is the "moving art." It's largely about tracking beats-"moving objects"-as they sequence through time.
- Males have a natural aptitude for spatial cognition (which, by the way, is associated with the hormone testosterone). As discussed in the section on brain lateralization, the right hemisphere of the brain is the location of both spatial cognition and the processing of harmony and pitch. This indicates the modules responsible for spatial cognition may handle harmony and pitch as "spatial" elements of sound.

# THE MORALISTIC FALLACY

When you turn the naturalistic fallacy on its head, you get the moralistic fallacy, sometimes called wishful thinking or political correctness. In the moralistic fallacy, "ought" = "is." That is, you

believe that what ought to be true actually is true-even though there's no logical connection between "ought" and "is."

A familiar example: human males and females ought to have the same brain structure and psychological constitution at birth. So imagicallyl...they do! Believing otherwise means condoning sexism. And, therefore, all of the empirical evidence showing that human males and females are in fact psychologically significantly different from each other at birth, shaped in the course of evolution by sex-based differences in adaptive pressures-all that evidence must somehow be wrong ishoot the messenger).

People believe all sorts of things about wonderful human nature-people aren't greedy, people don't lie, people don't cheat-merely because they ought to be true, despite evidence to the contrary.

As in many other species, human females have evolved as mate choosers. Human females have to make enormous investments of time, energy, and sacrifice in raising offspring. In North America, for example, women with children earn about 75 cents to men's dollar. However, childless career women earn just as much as men.

While females have evolved as mate choosers, males have evolved to display. Human males tend to become status-and-power competitors. Where opportunities arise, females tend to choose (except in cultures where parents arrange marriages) high-achieving (i.e., displaying) male mates.

In Palaeolithic times, men used physical power, aggressiveness, and competitive instincts to achieve status and power, and impress women. Today, men use the same inborn aggressiveness and competitiveness to achieve status and power in business, religion, politics, and justice-and impress women. As listed in Brown's Human Universals, human males dominate the institutions of power in every culture, a fact that will not likely change any time soon, despite wishful thinking. This is a trifle unsettling for the future of HH. sapiens as a species, considering human males exclusively build and control all the nuclear weapons in all the nations that have nukes.

MUSIC AS AN ADAPTATION SHAPED BY SEXUAL Selection: Proportions of Male and Female MUSICIANS

According to Darwin's sexual selection theory, males write and perform songs to impress females, ultimately for purposes of acquiring women to mate with. Musicianship in males tends to skyrocket after puberty, crests in young adulthood, and declines after marriage.

A male musician is not usually aware that his love of music-making probably stems from an inherently male competitive inclination to impress choosy females with a flashy display, like a peacock, that indicates survival and reproductive fitness. If runaway sexual selection began to shape the evolution of music one or two million years ago, the positive feedback loop would take the form of increasing demands for more impressive displays of musical talent, triggering ever greater cognitive functions, resulting in ever-swelling brain size. The theory would predict that, by now, a lopsided sex imbalance favouring male musicians would exist, regardless of musical genre, regardless of nation, regardless of culture.

And that's precisely what's observed. For example, one analysis of samples from more than 7,000 albums (rock, jazz, classical) revealed that the overwhelming majority of the principal music makers (more than 90%90% ) were male, regardless of musical genre.

The fact of pan-cultural male dominance of music gets little media attention. Yet flip through any magazine devoted to music, and you'll find that the great majority of composers, songwriters, and performers are male. It's like flipping though the sports pages of any newspaper, and for similar reasons that have roots in the evolutionary history of hominids.

Check out your own collection of recordings. Count the musicians by sex-not just the act's headliner, but all the musicians who play on each recording. (More often than not, a female star will have an all-male or mostly-male backing band, and will co-write her songs with male songwriters.) You'll likely find that the overwhelming majority of songwriters, vocalists, and instrumentalists in your own music collection are male, unless you make a point of deliberately searching out and collecting music composed and performed by women only.

Apart from your own collection, another sample worth checking out for malefemale proportions is the Gold Standard Song List (www. GoldStandardSongList.com), which lists 5,000 songs written over a 100-year period, spanning 14 genres.

All of the above notwithstanding ... just because far fewer women than men become career musicians, that does not mean women ought not to have a career in music. If you're a woman, and you write and/or perform music, you may well have heard some variant of the naturalistic fallacy with respect to women and music: if it's

found in nature (i.e., more men than women make a living in music), then that's the way it ought to be. Rubbish. There's no logical connection between "is" and "ought," which is why it's called the naturalistic fallacy. Sadly, in some cultures, adherence to the naturalistic fallacy prevents women who want a music career from having it.

Although the evidence clearly indicates males have a stronger drive than females to become musicians, males do not become better musicians than females who become musicians. Musical ambition does not equate with inherent musical ability.

# 1.5.15  
Why Is There Such a Thing as Music? How About "All of the Above"

When the smoke clears, why the heck did music evolve in humans - music that's so unlike the vocalizing of any other species?

Summary of three of the leading suspects:

## 1. Mother-infant Communication

No denying the reality of motherese, nor the universality of it, nor the survival value of it. Much evidence supports Ellen Dissanayake's hypothesis that motherese is, at its core, musical communication. Newborns and adults share many of the same musical preferences and skills.

The music-emotion connection originates with motherese and is linked directly with survival. In adults, this would help explain why humans have a high regard for intensely emotional music. Music competently composed and performed evokes survival-linked emotions in listeners. That's why audiences highly value performers and composers who can actually achieve such a feat. (Not many can.)

## 2. Social Bonding

Skinny little hominids would not have survived on the African savannah had they not clumped together in larger and larger groups. By what mechanism did they achieve and maintain group cohesion in the absence of language? Music certainly looks like a good candidate.

Plenty of evidence indicates music and group dancing serve as bonding mechanisms, ways of intensifying group solidarity and coordinating emotional arousal.

For tens or hundreds of thousands of years, since humans acquired the music adaptation, the only way to listen to music was in a group of a minimum of two-usually more than two. The ability to listen to music in solitude did not become possible until the advent of recording technology in the late 19th 19th  Century.

Everywhere in the world, most music-making takes place in group contexts. Groups such as bands, choirs, orchestras, and sports crowds perform for audiences who not only listen but often participate.

# 3. Sexual Selection

Darwin observed musical courtship displays in many species of animals, notably monogamous bird species, mostly during mating season. Conspicuously by males. According to Darwin's theory of sexual selection, the capacity for music in humans evolved as a sexually selected male courtship display, just as in other animals.

In every society, far more males than females have the urge to make music. Young males, predominantly. They say it's for art's sake, but they do it to get girls. It works. It's what would be expected in a sexually-selected trait.

Fisher's runaway sexual selection hypothesis, an elaboration of one aspect of Darwin's theory, would help explain the huge discrepancy in male vs female participation in human music making. While males and females are equally competent at creating and performing music, males tend to become obsessive about it after puberty. Male fascination with music continues until pair-bonding, after which it tends to drop off.

There's no reason to suppose that the various hypotheses about why music evolved in humans mutually exclude each other. It is a fact that the capacity for music, like the capacity for language, is in the brain at birth. After the motherese phase of life, the brain circuitry for music does not go away. Music remains a powerful means of emotional communication throughout life.

Mother-infant musical communication is inherently social, so it's reasonable that the social nature of music would continue to resonate in adulthood. This would help explain the group bonding properties of music in adults, even if music originally evolved for infant survival.

It would also help account for the use of music in courtship, as both emotional and social communication. As Dissanayake points out:

In humans, love songs and courtship speech use childish words and refer to childish things to create and display intimacy, for example, ... popular songs that express the (sentiment) ... 'Baby, I love you.'

When a guy sings lyrics using words such as "baby," and "mama," he doesn't realize how literal the lyrics are-an adult version of motherese, the musical motherinfant communication system.

(By the way, this has nothing to do with Freud's weird, unsupported hypotheses. While on the mark about each person having an active unconscious mind, Freud's bizarre theory of child psychosexual development, complete with Oedipus complex, Electra complex, phallic stage, and so on, amounts to fanciful hokum.)

Fisher's theory of runaway sexual selection may best explain encephalation in humans. Females select the smartest, most capable males to mate with. Their progeny, both male and female, become smarter and more capable over time. Women make ever-escalating demands for smart, capable mates. Men adapt by becoming even smarter and more capable (actually a courtship display). A feedback loop. Over a couple of million years, the cortex gets larger in both sexes.

If this explains encephalation in humans, then the human brain is the human equivalent of the peacock's tail, with human males responding to human females' obsession with brilliance by evolving more ways to display mental prowess, one of those ways-a major one-being music.

A final word on the "what-who-where-when-why" of music, from one of the greatest investigator-songwriters of all time...
