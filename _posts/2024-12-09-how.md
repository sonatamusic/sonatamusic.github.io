## How Melody and Melody-harmony Integration REALLY Work

A melody is a series of tones that makes sense. —VICTOR ZUCKERKANDL

## Evolution, Music, and Emotional Arousal

### 9.1.1

Why Music Is All About Emotion: Evolution AND THE ADAPTIVE PURPOSES OF THE EMOTIONS

Evidence on the evolutionary origin of music lends support to the view that if music is "about" anything, it's about the melody. That melody is the soul of music. (Everything is the soul of something, it seems. Ethanol is the soul of beer.)

Apart from lyrics, it is the melody, including melodic rhythm, that most people remember about a song. Harmony, while important, does not usually stick in longterm semantic memory the way melody does.

As discussed in Chapter 1, animal calls-the non-human equivalent of tunesare emotional in nature. Emotions evolved as adaptations with enormous survival value.

We humans are animals that vocalize in part to communicate information (language) but also to communicate our emotional state. A human mother and her baby use melodious vocalizing, among other things, to attune to each other emotionally. Since music communicates emotion, it may well owe its evolutionary origin to the survival value of inherently musical mother-infant communication.

Music, the saying goes, is the language of emotion. Even pre-school children can accurately identify specific emotions that music elicits. If the adaptive purpose of music is to communicate emotion, and if music is "about" melody, then clearly aa melody that fails to communicate emotion fails as music. This chapter explores some of the ways you can improve the odds that you will create melodies that succeed musically by communicating emotion.

# ANIMAL LANGUAGE TRANSLATORS

Male mice sing when they encounter female mice. isn't that nice? Men mice sing love songs to attract women mice. Alas, male mice sing at frequencies of 30 to 110 kHz -far above the range of human hearing. So humans never hear their melodious serenading as they scurry through the house at night, avoiding traps.

Dogs and cats don't sing, but they make emotional noises well within human hearing range. So, naturally, humans have found a way to cash in on the unworldiness of pet owners who think dog barks and cat meows mean something specific, other than 'hey!' A Japanese company successfully markets 'dog translators' and 'cat translators' to gullible pet owners, providing more evidence that pets are more intelligent than their owners. So far, hundreds of thousands of credulous humans have shelled out $75$75 to $100$100 for the devices, but no dogs or cats have paid for 'human translators.'

# Dialogue Is Not Enough: Emotion and Film Music

In a novel, the writer describes for you, without dialogue, the interior lives of characters: what they're thinking and how they're feeling emotionally. In a film, you have action, dialogue, facial expressions-and music. Movies hardly ever lack a musical sound track. Music arouses the emotions of an audience. Through music, the audience shares characters' emotional experiences.

Even in the era of the so-called "silent movie," a musician-typically a pianist or organist-played along with the movie to provide the emotional experience associated with characters' actions. Then "talkies" came along and the film-music industry briefly died away. Movie makers quickly discovered that, even with audible dialogue and other sound effects, something was missing. Talkies without music were emotionally impoverished. Soon, movie makers restored music to the cinematic experience, and music became as essential to talking pictures as it had been to silent films. Music has remained a central aspect of the movies ever since. Psychologist Annabel Cohen, a specialist in music cognition, sums up the role of music in film:

The capacity of music to accomplish the emotional task ... may be based on the ability of music to simultaneously carry many kinds of emotional information in its harmony, rhythm, melody, timbre, and tonality. Real life entails multiple emotions, simultaneously and in succession. Miraculously, yet systematically, these complex relationsthis 'emotional polyphony'-can be represented by the musical medium.

Music is usually lacking in stage plays other than musicals because of synchronizing. In live theatre, no two live productions are the same each night. Also, music costs more money than theatre companies can afford.

### 9.1.2  
EMOTIONAL REACTIONS AS RESPONSES TO SURPRISE OR CHANGE

You have an emotional response when you experience surprise or uncertainty-the discrepancy between what you expect to happen and what actually happens. You experience positive or negative emotions, depending on whether the unexpected event improves or threatens your survival prospects or your capacity to send your genes into the future.

One of the main reasons you remember exciting events much better than ordinary experiences is that adrenaline enhances the formation of memories. It speeds up

memory-making. When you experience a big surprise-positive or negative-you feel a surge of adrenaline and react emotionally.

- You're walking along the main street of Dodge, minding your own business, when suddenly-surprise!-a pack of snarling wild dogs bursts out of the Wrong Ranch Saloon and charges straight at you. Rush of adrenaline. Negative emotional reaction.
- You check your lottery ticket numbers, expecting nothing again this week (as every week for the past 14 years). Instead-surprise!-you discover you've won $87,412,162.19$87,412,162.19. Rush of adrenaline. Positive emotional reaction.

When you hear a piece of music, it begins by creating a world of tonality and regular beat. Sequences of chords and tones and phrases set up "normal" expectations.

As the song unfolds through time, your brain tries to predict what will happen next, based on what's already happened. Too much successful prediction causes disinterest and boredom. Too little leads to confusion.

For instance, when you hear a V7 chord, you anticipate that it will resolve to the tonic chord. If your brain's prediction turns out wrong-the resolution does not happen when you expect it to happen-you're surprised, uncertain about when the resolution will happen. You experience emotional arousal.

The longer the delay, before the V7 chord resolves, the more intense the emotional arousal. If the V7 chord then progresses to a chord other than the tonic chord (deceptive cadence), emotional intensity increases even more. When resolution to the tonic finally comes, you get another emotional jolt, a rush of pleasure.

The best music elicits both negative and positive emotions by continually creating uncertainty- violating expectations-and then resolving the uncertainty.

This goes on simultaneously in all the elements of a song as it unfolds in time:

- Harmony: The chord progression wanders away from the tonic chord, challenging tonality with chords other than simple triads. (As discussed in earlier chapters, different chord types elicit different kinds of emotions.) But sooner or later, tonality gets the upper hand and uncertainty is resolved.
    
- Melody: The tune challenges tonality by wandering away from the tonic note, forming complex-ratio intervals, creating uncertainty, which is allayed when, every so often, the tune returns to the tonic note.
    
- Rhythm: VM phrases and instrumental solos create uncertainty in the way their rhythm patterns contrast with the (completely predictable) underlying beat. VM and instrumental solo phrase patterns usually repeat every two or four or eight structural bars, alleviating the uncertainty.
    
- Form: In many songs, structural phrases vary unexpectedly from the four-bar norm, creating uncertainty. (An example discussed later in this chapter is "Hey Ya" by Outkast.) An unusual structure usually repeats many times throughout the song, creating a pattern that becomes familiar and relieves the uncertainty.
    
- Lyrics: Meaning keeps changing in the verses, creating uncertainty. Some phrases keep recurring in the form of a chorus, creating familiarity that dispels the uncertainty to a degree. If there's no chorus, repeated words or phrases in the verses serve the same purpose.
    

As discussed in Chapter 7, emotionally significant experiences are stored in episodic memory and "emotionally tagged." If you perform a set of songs that arouses an audience emotionally, they will remember that experience, especially if you give them some musical moments so surprising and startling that they experience an adrenaline rush or two. They will remember you and your performance. And they will buy your music.

But if you perform a set of songs that fails to stir them emotionally, they will not remember the experience. Or you.

Music increases general emotional arousal, but not everyone necessarily has the same specific kind of positive or negative emotional experience. Music can and does trigger many kinds of emotion simultaneously and also in succession. For example, a song may induce a similar intensity of emotional arousal in two people, but one may feel intense anxiety while the other feels intense excitement.

People enjoy emotionally-charged music, even if the valence is negative and the intensity is strong. Like going to a movie or listening to a story, the context is controlled. (See Section 2.4.3).

# Avoiding Habituation

As a songwriter, you want your songs to elicit some kind of emotional response in your audience. Empirical evidence shows that music actually creates expectations. If you play a melody for a listener, then stop it suddenly, the listener has a pretty clear expectation of how the tune "ought" to continue.

Although repetition is essential in music, if a musical element becomes too predictable, if there's not enough change or variety, habituation sets in, which decreases emotional arousal (left side of Wundt curve). To avoid habituation, it's

necessary to keep introducing novelty in one or more elements throughout the song: new melody, lyrics, chords, instrumental solos, background harmonies. For example, it's common for lead instruments to play solos in the gaps between VM phrases, and between the main sections such as the verses, choruses, and the middle eight.

## Everybody's On Drugs: Natural, BRAIN-MANUFACTURED DRUGS

Pleasurable activities such as eating stimulate pleasure centres in the brain, rewarding and reinforcing behaviour that has clear survival value. Listening to music and making music cause the brain to generate natural pleasure-inducing drugs. As discussed in Chapter 1, the pleasure you get from music, like the pleasure you get from eating, has survival value, or music would not have evolved as an adaptation.

Non-medical hedonic drug-taking stimulates pleasure centres but has no survival value. The effects wear off due to habituation, but you remember what caused the pleasure, which may lead to addiction-clearly a survival disadvantage. Natural selection designed pleasure to be fleeting. If whatever made you happy did not wear off, you would only do it once.

Hedonic drug-taking only began when humans discovered how to manufacture and ingest drugs that the brain mistakes for natural, brain-created drugs. It's a cultural phenomenon that has been around only for a few millennia in some regions of the world, and a few centuries in other regions.

## THE SACRED DRUNKEN MOOSE OF SWEDEN

In 2004, soprano Birgit Nilsson became only the second Swede ever to win the coveted Moose Nobel Prize in Music, the world's most prestigious music prize (see Appendix 3).

Speaking of moose, every autumn across central Sweden, moose get drunk on apples that have fallen and fermented. The moose lose their inhibitions and wander into cities and towns, looking for a good time and getting into trouble. Sometimes they attack people without provocation. Occasionally they stagger into houses and wreck the Ikea furniture.

But Swedes love and forgive their intoxicated moose. Why? Because Swedes consider the moose a sacred animal, which explains the shock and awe the H.U.M.S. members experienced

when the original Moose Verdi galloped up to them, outside the Swedish Academy of Music back in 1901.

In Sweden, hunters are not allowed to shoot sacred moose, just as hunters are not allowed to shoot sacred cows in India. In fact, the Swedish home furnishings giant Ikea uses an image of a sacred moose as its sacred company mascot and sacred corporate logo. Ikea has worked out an arrangement with the Swedish government whereby, if a hunter in Sweden goes out into the bush and shoots a moose, Ikea will fly in a bounty hunter from Dodge City to track down and shoot the moose hunter. (Marshal McDillon loves this gig, as it gives him the opportunity, while in Sweden, to shop for Ikea home furnishings that you can't get in Dodge.) Fortunately, Ikea has only had to dispatch bounty hunters a dozen or so times, as the great majority of Swedes are law-abiding and respect the sacred place of the moose in the Swedish way of life. In fact, if you look hard enough on the Internet, you will even find Swedish moose fetish cults, usually affiliated with Swedish thrash and death metal bands such as the seminal band, Moose at the Gates.

Here's a brief account of how various hedonic drugs work in the brain, summarized by Steven Johnson in Mind Wide Open:

IThe drugl ecstasy floods the brain with excess serotonin. Cocaine increases the availability of dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin. Hallucinogens like LSD achieve some of their effects by imitating the serotonin molecule. Amphetamines release dopamine and noradrenaline. Nicotine mimics dopamine molecules, as well as activating nicotine receptors. Alcohol and other tranquillizers have a more generalized effect, decreasing the activity of GABA (gammaaminobutyric acid, an inhibitory neurotransmitter) in the brain. Opiates, as their name suggests, pass for the brain's naturally occurring opioids.

Research on motivation for choosing a career in music indicates many performers claim to choose music as a profession for hedonic reasons. They simply want to keep experiencing the pleasure, the emotional rush that music induces.

The brain's main pleasure-drugs are the opioids and oxytocin, the "love drug" associated with childbirth, romantic attachment, and social bonding. Animals fail to form pair bonds when researchers block their brains' oxytocin receptors. Evidence indicates music may trigger the release of oxytocin. David Huron, a specialist in music cognition, explains that:

Although in contemporary society music tends to be experienced in a personalized or individualized listening context, we already know

that this context is historically unprecedented. Most music making in hunter-gatherer societies occurs in a social or group context. Until the invention of the phonograph, the vast majority of music in Western culture was also experienced in social or group contexts.

The pleasure associated with music in a "group context" drives people to seek music to regulate moods-get out of a bad mood, relieve anxiety-by, for example, going out with others to a club or concert.

The emotional effect of music subsides when the music ceases, but you remember what it was that aroused that emotion. Which is why you can listen to the same piece of music time after time and derive pleasure from it. Each time, the music triggers a little drug rush in your brain and you feel the related emotion.

# ROMANTIC LOVE = OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER

Speaking of being on brain-manufactured drugs, what is the difference between being in love and suffering from obsessivecompulsive disorder?

Not much, apparently. A controlled study comparing patients with obsessivecompulsive disorder with people in love and 'normal' people (not in love) revealed strong neurochemical similarities between the obsessive-compulsives and the "in-loves."

See "Love is The Drug" on the Gold Standard Song List for more information.

Melody, Memory, and Memes

### 9.2.1  
How Songs Function as Powerful Memes, REPLICATING AND MUTATING LIKE GENES

In his landmark book, The Selfish Gene, Richard Dawkins introduced the concept of the meme (rhymes with "team"), the unit of cultural transmission. Memes have genelike properties. Anything humans create, hold in memory, and pass on to future generations and other members of the same generation is a meme.

## A song that becomes a classic is a successful meme.

Memes have properties analogous to the those of the gene, the unit of biological transmission. Robust memes live on, get transmitted throughout the population and become part of the "meme pool." Feeble memes are forgotten-they become extinct. Feeble memes include nearly all of the mediocre original songs written by nearly all (clueless) songwriters.

Memes propagate via a process analogous to, but not the same as, Darwinian natural selection. The mechanics of Darwinian natural selection apply:

1. Selection. Selective pressure must exist. Memes evolve to fit imposed environmental conditions (differential fitness, or survival of the fittest). For example, if a song causes enough people to experience enough pleasure, they will remember it and the song will become a classic, such as Dylan's "All Along The Watchtower," especially the Jimi Hendrix cover recording.
2. Variation. Variability must exist. Songs are created in many genres. Any given song can be performed and recorded in any number of styles by any number of artists. The searing Hendrix recording of "All Along the Watchtower," much different from Dylan's original acoustic rendition, has always been far more popular.
3. Heredity. Replication must occur in order to pass on memetic mutations to future generations. Many more people learned "All Along the Watchtower" and passed it on to others because of the Hendrix version (a mutation) than would have been the case had Hendrix not covered the song.

A large number of memes can exist as "meme complexes." Religions and political parties, for instance. In music, a style or genre is a meme complex.

This does not mean that there's such a thing as "cultural evolution." There isn't. Memetics merely explains how ideas-memes-spread through populations. Songs, for example, do not come about because of song mutations. Creative songwriters dream up songs. The natural selection analogy does not apply to the origin of memes such as songs-only to the way memes propagate.

A meme is a physical, biological entity. Every song you know, for instance, exists in your brain (your long-term semantic memory) in the form of a network or networks of neurons. When you teach somebody a song, that person forms the same or similar neuronal structure in his or her brain. You have propagated your songmeme.

Unlike genes, which can only propagate from generation to generation though time, memes can propagate "horizontally"-throughout a population of the same generation. Anything that humans create and can hold in memory and pass on to future generations is a meme. A song, for instance.

# 9.2.2  
Why Most of the World's Brilliant Tunes HAVE Not Yet BEEN COMPOSED

The memes we call tunes can exist in practically infinite variety because music is combinatorial, like language and the genetic code. Some songwriters think that all the great melodies have already been composed ... there will never again be songwriters and composers as great as, say, Mozart or Lennon-McCartney or Chopin or Ellington or Schubert or Kern or any other great composer you care to name.

Rubbish. How many possible tunes are there? To get an idea, consider the number of combinations you have to choose from. Suppose you start with some conservative restrictions, such as:

- A compass of 19 semitones, the pitch range of "The Star Spangled Banner"
- A note value no longer than one bar in duration (four beats in simple quadruple meter)
- A note value no shorter than one-eighth of a bar in duration

Almost anyone could sing any tune you might create within these parameters.

At the beginning of bar one, you have a choice of 20 notes ( 19 semitone intervals =20=20 notes) or a rest, for a total of 21 note possibilities, if you think of a rest as a "silent note." Each note (or rest) can have one of eight duration values.

So, off the top, you have 21 notes x 8 duration values =168=168 choices. Select one. Now that you've made your first choice, you again have 168 choices for the second note (or rest). The first note (or rest) you selected does not in any way affect your selection of a second note (or rest). Therefore, the number of two-note combinations is 168×168=28,224168×168=28,224.

Continuing on, by the time your tune reaches eight note-rest combinations, the number of possibilities has grown to (in round numbers) 634,600,000,000,000,000634,600,000,000,000,000. That's 634.6 quadrillion possible melodies (at least in America and Canada, but not in the UK, France, or Germany, where quadrillion means something different; but who's counting?).

Most tunes have way more than eight note-rest combinations. So the number of possible combinations of singable songs is vastly greater than a mere 634.6 quadrillion.

The number of possible tunes that could be composed in only a few bars is so enormous that, even if only a tiny fraction of them would sound appealing to human ears, humanity would have to exist for many millions of years for songwriters to get around to composing and recording all the possible great melodies.

In other words, most of the world's brilliant tunes are still up for grabs, waiting to be composed ...

# "BETTER THAN THE BEATLES"

Well, what can anyone say about The Shaggs? Dot, Heather, and Betty land sometimes Rachel), the Wiggin sisters, from Fremont, New Hampshire.

An unbelievable band. Unbelievable. A band that played impossible original music for five years (1968 - 1973). Impossible music. Nobody in the history of the world has ever played such impossible music.

Frank Zappa is said to have proclaimed that The Shaggs were "better than The Beatles." Indeed. The Shaggs recorded an alltime classic album, Philosophy of the World, an impossible album, an album that will probably live on, long after Abbey Road is forgotten.

If you've never heard The Shaggs, here's the website: [www.Shaggs.com](http://www.shaggs.com/)

# 9.3  
Melodic Unity and Coherence

### 9.3.1

## Establishing Tonality with Melody

In Chapter 5, you learned about the importance of establishing tonality. You can't create musical uncertainty and the emotion that goes with it until you first establish musical certainty in the form of tonality. Harmonically, you can establish tonality by using the V7 chord, which points unequivocally to the tonic.

Melodically, you can help establish tonality by using scale degrees 1,3,41,3,4, and/or 5 early in the melody. Particularly in metrically accented positions. You don't have to rigorously use all of these key-defining notes, of course. But the more of them you use, and the earlier, the sooner you will be able to modulate.

## Modulation in "Street Fighting Man"

- The verse of the Jagger-Richards classic, "Street Fighting Man," is in the key of C , using only the I and IV chords, and only scale degrees 1 and 4 in the melody.
    
- For the chorus, the song modulates to the key of G. The melody of the chorus is drawn exclusively from scale degrees 1,3,41,3,4, and 5 of the new key (the notes G,B,CG,B,C, and D ). This firmly establishes tonality in the new key, G major.
    
- The modulation is further reinforced when the harmony moves to the V chord of the new key (the chord D major) and melody to the leading tone, F#F#, a note that is foreign to the original key, C major.
    
- The song's musical effectiveness derives from the alternation between two keys, C major for verses and G major for choruses. Skilful use of scale degrees 1,3,41,3,4, and 5 make the modulation effective.
    

It's not just for the sake of modulation that it's wise to establish tonality early, using the notes of the key's tonic triad. Once established, you can stay in the same key and go nuts with non-chord diatonic tones, leaps, sequences, and other techniques discussed later in this chapter.

# 9.3.2  
Melodic CoHERENCE and InTELligIBILITY

Music, like prose, has to be intelligible. Audiences don't remember unstructured, inaccessible tunes (extreme right side of the Wundt curve). That applies to the way melodies work within structural phrases, and also to the ways melodies themselves are structured.

Even infants without previous musical exposure prefer coherent melody and harmony. You need a certain amount of melodic and harmonic novelty to create interest, but too much causes confusion and reduces interest.

The smallest melodic unit that has any meaning, much as the smallest unit of words in language that has any meaning, is the phrase. And, as with language, successive musical phrases need to be related to each other if they are to stick in a listener's memory.

When you write a song, you have to incorporate enough change in the various musical and lyrical elements to keep things unpredictable and exciting, but not so much novelty that coherence melts away.

Later in this chapter, you'll learn some specific techniques you can use to strike the right balance. Top of the Wundt curve.

### 9.3.3  
IMPORTANCE OF A PRACTICAL VOCAL RANGE

The melodies of most great songs range from seven semitones (an interval of a perfect fifth) to 19 semitones (an octave and a fifth). Most people can handle 19 semitones. That's the range of "The Star Spangled Banner."

Tessitura refers to pitch compass or range. Male voices are lower in tessitura than female voices. For example, a woman with a soprano voice and a man with a baritone voice can each sing a tune that spans 19 semitones, but each in his or her

own tessitura. The soprano could not sing the tune in the baritone's tessitura, and vice-versa (except perhaps in falsetto).

Tessitura also refers to the pitch compass of a song or composition. You'll notice that the notes of the verses of some songs cluster in the lower pitch range-tessitura-of the song. Then, in the chorus, the notes cluster in the upper tessitura. The melody may only have a range of 12 to 15 semitones, but the sections are divided tessitura-wise to create contrast.

Think twice before deliberately setting out to write a melody with a low-tessitura verse and a rousing, high-tessitura chorus. Like shift modulation (the dreaded Truck Driver's Gear Change), this practice has been over-done to the point of abuse. As you'll see, there are many other ways to conjure melodic magic.

# 9.4

## Tune and Chord Progression

### 9.4.1

## Melodic vs Harmonic Force of Intervals

Melody is comprised of intervals, some of which have more harmonic force than melodic force:

- Intervals with strong harmonic force in a melodic context: fifth, fourth, major and minor thirds. As discussed in Section 9.3, these intervals help establish tonality.
- Intervals with moderate harmonic force in a melodic context: major and minor sixth. About equally harmonic and melodic.
- Intervals with weak harmonic force in a melodic context: major second, minor second, major seventh, minor seventh. Seconds are the quintessential melodic intervals.

For the sake of maintaining unity within variety, when melody proceeds in intervals of seconds that land on metrically accented positions, you can use consonant simple triads to ensure that the dissonant seconds-non-chord tonesstand out. (A section on non-chord tones is coming up.)

Conversely, when the melody proceeds in thirds and fifths, you can use dissonant chords to offset the harmonically consonant melodic intervals.

# 9.4.2  
Relative Speed of Melody Against Harmony: Emotional Effects

In a well-structured song, chords progress in a non-random, coherent way. They relate to each other, drawn mainly from the circular harmonic scale of the prevailing key (Appendix 1). Simultaneously, the tones of the melody also proceed nonrandomly, drawn from the diatonic scale of the same prevailing key. Although melody and harmony unfold at different paces, the two nevertheless relate to each other in such a way as to sound unified.

The correspondence between harmony and melody can take three forms.

## 1. Harmony Moves Slower than Melody ("Normal" or Default)

This is the default in popular music and most other music that has harmonic motion. Typically chords change every bar or two, sometimes twice in a bar, sometimes only once every four or more bars. The faster the tempo, the more bars go by between chord changes. But, because of the quick pace, elapsed time between chord changes is about the same as at moderate tempo.

## 2. Harmony Moves Faster than Melody

This is what happens when a tone of the melody is held or extended while the chords change. This technique creates surprise and resulting emotional response"Why isn't the note moving? When is the note going to change?"-that gets satisfactorily resolved when the note finally resolves and the "normal" succession of tones resumes.

## 3. Harmony and Melody Move at the Same Speed

When chords change with every melodic note, the overall pace tends to be slow and the emotional effect solemn. Chords have a lot of musical weight or mass, as it were, compared to melodic notes. So when chords change with every melodic note, the brain perceives that a lot of power or energy is being expended to move so much mass so frequently.

Although type 1 above prevails most of the time, great songs sometimes have instances of types 2 and 3, each of which surprises the listener and elicits an emotional reaction.

# 9.4.3

## CADENCE IN ITS MELODIC CONTEXT

In Section 6.6.12, you learned about cadence in its harmonic context, especially the role of the all-important V chord, called the dominant chord for good reason.

Most of the time, the chord that accompanies the last note of a VM phrase is either the V chord (an imperfect cadence, also called a half cadence or half close) or the tonic chord (a perfect cadence, also called a full cadence or full close).

The frequency with which cadences occur has major implications for melodic coherence.

## If cadences involving the V chord occur too far apart, a series of VM (vocal-melodic) phrases will not sound cohesive-one of the most common songwriting mistakes.

As you'll see later in this chapter, VM phrases tend to occur in groups of two or four within eight-bar structural phrases. The first VM phrase of a pair (or pair grouping) usually ends on the V chord or the tonic chord. Sometimes it ends on some chord other than V chord or the tonic, such as the IV chord or the IIm chord.

If a VM phrase starts with tonic chord accompaniment and the melody includes notes of the tonic chord (scale degrees 1,3, and 5), tonality is established firmly enough that the intermediate cadence can be some formulation other than V7 - I. But, for the sake of melodic coherence, the V chord is likely to enter the picture in a cadence position somewhere in the eight-bar period.

There are no set cadence formulas. But there's no question that the V (or V7) chord and the V7 - I perfect cadence work wonders in holding a melody together structurally. Few great songs go on for 16 bars without a single instance of a V or V7 chord resolving directly or indirectly to the tonic chord.

## Cadence, Continuation, and Conclusiveness

Melody has harmonic implications, and vice versa. You can't really disentangle the two. Cadence is equal parts harmonic and melodic. The note on which a VM phrase ends, and the chord that accompanies it, together constitute a cadence.

For a feeling of continuation, the chord progression accompanying a VM phrase usually ends on:

- The V or V7 chord; or
- Some other chord non-tonic chord such as IV or IIm or VIm; or
- A variant of the tonic chord, such as the seventh (e.g., C7 in the key of C major).

Melodically, in a "continuing" cadence, the VM phrase lands on some note other than the tonic.

A continuing cadence tends to occur at the end of the first of a pair of VM phrases, with the second VM phrase ending on the tonic note.

For a feeling of conclusiveness, the chord progression typically moves from V7 to the tonic chord. But when the chord progression moves to the tonic chord, conclusiveness may not be absolute. It depends on where the melody lands.

The melody usually lands on one of three scale degrees:

- Scale degree 1, the most conclusive-sounding
- Scale degree 5, less conclusive-sounding
- Scale degree 3, still less conclusive-sounding

If a cadence consists of the tonic chord combined, melodically, with scale degree 5 or 3 , it often functions as a continuing cadence, despite the tonic chord harmony.

One of the most common and structurally sound ways to write a period is to end the first phrase with some type of continuing cadence, and the second with a conclusive V7 - I cadence with the melody landing on scale degree 1. But this is by no means a stock formula.

Melodically, the two VM phrases may be similar, in a sequential relationship (more on sequences later in this chapter). Or they might contrast, as for example, when the first VM phrase ends on a note either considerably higher or considerably lower than the first note of the phrase, and the second VM phrase takes the melodic line back to the opening note.

# Masculine vs Feminine Cadence

A masculine cadence occurs when the final note of a VM or melodic phrase falls on a metrically strong beat:

- The first or third beat of the second, third, or fourth bar in quadruple meter
- The first beat of the second, third or fourth bar in triple meter

A feminine cadence occurs when the final note of a vocal or melodic phrase falls on a metrically weak beat:

- The second or fourth beat of the second, third, or fourth bar in quadruple meter
- The second or third beat of the second, third or fourth bar in triple meter

Practically every popular song has masculine cadences. Which is why feminine cadences tend to stand out. If you hear a feminine cadence, it's usually in an

intermediate structural position, such as the second bar of a structural phrase. In which case it's usually followed by a masculine cadence in the fourth bar.

A good example of an intermediate feminine cadence is the opening two-bar VM phrase of Gordon Lightfoot's "If You Could Read My Mind." The last note of the VM phrase (the word "love") falls on the fourth beat of the second bar. What makes it stand out, apart from being a feminine cadence, is that the last melodic interval leaps from scale degree five ("mind") up to the tonic ("love"), an interval of a perfect fourth, which gives the last note a striking pitch accent on the off-beat.

Occasionally, a creative songwriter will use a feminine cadence at the end of a structural phrase or period, where such cadences seldom occur. An example is the last four-bar phrase of the verse of the Lennon-McCartney song, "Golden Slumbers" -the vocal line, "Sleep, pretty darling, do not cry ... and I will sing a lullaby-ee."

Here are the last two bars. The chord progression is the standard full-close V7I:

The effect is particularly striking because, not only does the feminine cadence occur at the end of a period (and the end of a verse, repeated at the end the chorus), but the last interval ("by-ee") is a big leap, from the scale degree three up to the tonic, an interval of a minor sixth (eight semitones). A startling, unexpected pitch accent that seizes the listener's attention.

VM Phrases Within Structural Phrases: From Weill and Brecht to Bowie and Beck

### 9.5.1

## Binary Structure at the Period Level

Experimental evidence indicates that, to make a tune memorable, chunking and Gestalt grouping principles must apply. Chapter 8 emphasized the main unifying structural factor in songwriting: four-bar structural phrases forming eight-bar periods. They dominate, regardless of genre, meter, tempo, verse-chorus structure, etc. Within a pair of structural phrases, VM phrases can be short or long, and arranged in a variety of ways.

This section presents 16 pairs of structural phrases (periods) from 16 different Gold Standard songs, showing the positioning of VM phrases within each eight-bar period.

### 9.5.2

## WUNDT CURVE ANALYSES

Each of the 16 songs examined has been successful over the long term, both artistically and commercially, because the songwriters managed to balance unity and variety. Each song perches atop the Wundt curve.

How did the songwriters do it? The Wundt curve analysis for each example provides an explanation with respect to the structural aspect. Read and understand the commentary for each example, apply the techniques to your own songwriting, and you'll have another tool at your disposal that will help you create tunes that are far superior to the lame melodies of 99%99% of songwriters.

If you're keen, draw your own grids and sketch in the remaining periods and VM phrases for each of the 16 songs. You may also wish to re-visit Section 8.2.3, "Techniques of Variation within Binary Structure."

Try doing your own Wundt curve analyses of the VM phrases not shown in the 16 examples.

- How do great songwriters achieve unity (left side of the Wundt curve)? As you'll see in the examples, the answer in most cases is not simply "exact repetition." It's more subtle than that. Those subtleties spell the difference between greatness and mediocrity in creating VM phrases and positioning them in structural phrases. So reflect on the details.
- And how do great songwriters simultaneously achieve variety (right side of the Wundt curve)? Again, you'll learn how if you study the details in the commentary.

Pay particular attention to the balance between unity and variety in each example. To get even more practice, do some sketches, like the ones in the examples, of other songs that have stood the test of time, and that you personally admire. Determine meter, tempo, vocal start points with respect to beat one of bar one of structural phrases, VM phrase positioning within structural phrases, VM phrase lengths, intervals between VM phrases, use of sequences, and so on. Most importantly, do Wundt curve analyses to learn the details of unity-variety balance. The more you do this, the more you will improve your understanding of how to consistently create emotionally powerful tunes.

## 16 EXAMPLES

These 16 examples represent nearly all the major genres, the most commonly used meters, all four of the tempo ranges, and all three of the possible VM phrase start points with respect to structural phrases.

In each diagram:

- The VM phrases are indicated in black, the intervals between the VM phrases in white.
- Capital letters (A, B, C ...) identify different VM phrases within an eight-bar period. If the VM phrase repeats after an interval, the repeated VM phrase(s) has the same letter designation. In such cases, the melody usually repeats but the words are usually different. Not always, though.
- Where numbers follow capital letters (A1, A2), the second VM phrase repeats melodically as a sequence (repetition at a different pitch).

Each diagram represents only eight bars of the song-not the whole song. Go to a music download website, get any of the recordings of the 16 songs that you don't have (the original recording by the songwriter, except where indicated in the examples coming up) and use them to follow the commentary about each eight-bar period.

1. "Space Oddity" (David Bowie)

Meter: Simple quadruple Tempo: Slow (65 BPM) Vocal starts: After beat 1 of bar 1 of the structural phrase Song part: Verse Wundt curve: Left side/unity: The first VM phrase ("A") occurs 3 timesboth words and music-in only 8 bars. Right side/variety: The "B" VM phrase starts in the same metrical position as the first "A" VM phrase (more unity), but is longer and has a contrasting melody and different

3. "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry" (Hank Williams, Sr.)

Meter: Combined triple Tempo: Moderate (112 BPM) Vocal starts: Before beat 1 of bar 1 of the structural phrase (anacrusis) Song part: Verse Wundt curve: Left side/unity: 3 iterations of the same prominent melodic interval (a major third) in the first VM phrase, 2 iterations in the second VM phrase. Right side/variety: The second instance of the VM phrase begins in the same metrical position as the first, and has the same tune, but contrasts because it is truncated by 1 bar. The 2 VM phrases also have different words. As well, this song is in combined triple meter-not common in popular songs-which makes it stand out. (A)

4. "Superstition" (Stevie Wonder)

Meter: Simple quadruple Tempo: Fast (200 BPM) Vocal starts: Before beat 1 of bar 1 of the structural phrase (anacrusis) Song part: Verse Wundt curve: Left side/unity: The "A" and "B" phrases have identical numbers of notes (6) in their melodic rhythms. An identical instrumental riff occupies the long interval following each VM phrase. Right side/variety: The tunes and words of the 2 VM phrases are different. Also, the 2 VM phrases begin a full bar before beat 1 of bar 1 of the structural phrases. A long anacrusis commands attention because it's unusual. (A)

5. "Brown Sugar" (Jagger-Richards/The Rolling Stones)

Meter: Simple quadruple Tempo: Moderate (128 BPM) Vocal starts: After beat 1 of bar 1 of the structural phrase Song part: Chorus Wundt curve: Left side/unity: The musical elements of the "A" and "B" VM phrases repeat exactly in the second structural phrase. Also, the lyrics are the same in the 2 iterations of the "A" VM phrase (the words, "brown sugar"). Right side/variety: 2 different VM phrases within each structural phrase. The words are different in the 2 iterations of the "B" VM phrase. Also, the first VM phrase within each structural phrase begins far into the structural phrase-the second beat of the second bar. Unusual and ear-grabbing-the opposite of the "Superstition" VM phrases, which begin way before the structural phrase.

6. "Mack The Knife" (Weill-Brecht; REC: Louis Armstrong; Bobby Darin's cover of Armstrong's arrangement)

Meter: Combined quadruple Tempo:  Lively (172 BPM) Vocal starts: Before beat 1 of bar 1 of the structural phrase (anacrusis) Song part: Verse Wundt curve: Left side/unity: 3 consecutive iterations of the first VM phrase. The third iteration is in the same metrical position as the first, within their respective structural phrases. Right side/variety: In the Louis Armstrong (Bobby Darin) arrangement, the fourth VM phrase ("B") is both shorter ( 3 notes instead of 4 ) and has a different melody. All 4 VM phrases have different words.

Meter: Compound quadruple Tempo: Slow (64 BPM) Vocal starts: Before beat 1 of bar 1 of the structural phrase (anacrusis) Song part: Verse Wundt curve: Left side/unity: The musical elements of all 3 VM phrases, "A", "B", and "C", repeat exactly in the second structural phrase. Right side/variety: The words are different for all 6 VM phrases. The song is in compound quadruple meter, and the tempo is slow-characteristics that set this song apart from all the moderate-tempo songs in simple quadruple meter. (A) (B) (A) 8. "Going Back To Harlan" (Anna McGarrigle; REC: Emmylou Harris)

Meter: Simple quadruple Tempo: Lively (166 BPM) Vocal starts: Before beat 1 of bar 1 of the structural phrase (anacrusis) Song part: Chorus Wundt curve: Left side/unity: The words "I'm going back to Harlan" repeat with the same melody and melodic rhythm. Right side/ variety: No variety in this 8 -bar period! An unusual case, as most 8 -bar periods do have some internal variety, if only in the lyrics. In this song, the variety is in the other periods, and in the musical and lyrical contrasts between verses and choruses. This is one song you need to listen to from the top to appreciate how ace songwriter Anna McGarrigle deftly balances unity and variety. (A) (A) (A) A starts again

A woman without her man is nothing But the VM phrasing of the two entries was different. Marshal McDillon's went like

The two versions of that line became well-known in Dodge, then spread to Wichita, then Kansas City, and eventually around the world.

9. "You Make Me Feel Like A Natural Woman"(King-Goffin; REC: Aretha Franklin)

Meter: Combined triple Tempo: Moderate (112 BPM) Vocal starts: Before beat 1 of bar 1 of the structural phrase (anacrusis) Song part: Chorus Wundt curve: Left side/unity: 3 consecutive exact iterations of the first VM phrase, both musically and lyrically ("You make me feel").

The "B" VM phrase contrasts both lyrically and musically from the "A" VM phrase. "B" is almost twice as long and has a different melody.

"Be My Yoko Ono" (Page-Robertson; REC: Barenaked Ladies)

Meter: Simple quadruple Tempo: Fast (236 BPM) Vocal starts: After beat 1 of bar 1 of the structural phrase Song part: Chorus Wundt curve: Left side/unity: Not much, except that the "A" and "B" phrases start at the same point within their respective structural phrases. This is the opposite of"Going Back to Harlan" (all unity, no variety). Like "Harlan," you need to listen to this song from the top to appreciate the unifying elements. For example, the title phrase "be my Yoko Ono" repeats 9 times. Right side/variety: In this period, the 2 VM phrases contrast, both musically and lyrically. The tempo of this song is flying, about double the "default" tempo range. Speed like that gets a song noticed.

11. "Over the Rainbow" (Arlen-Harburg; REC: Judy Garland)

Meter: Simple quadruple Tempo: Slow (88 BPM) Vocal starts: On beat 1 of bar 1 of the structural phrase (or after in some recordings) Song part: Verse Wundt curve: Left side/unity: The second VM phrase, "A2" is a musical sequence: it repeats the melody of the first phrase, but at a lower pitch. The melody of the third bar of "A1" echos that of the first bar, but at a lower pitch. The melody of the second and third bars of "A2" form a sequence. Right side/variety: "A1" and "A2" do not form a "perfect" sequence. The third bar of "A2" does not follow the third bar of "A1" sequentially. Also, the lyrics of "A1" differ from the lyrics of "A2". A1 A2 12. "Folsom Prison Blues" (Johnny Cash)

Meter: Simple quadruple Tempo: Fast (222 BPM) Vocal starts: Before beat 1 of bar 1 of the structural phrase (anacrusis) Song part: Verse Wundt curve: Left side/unity: 3 consecutive iterations of the "A" VM phrase. The first and third have the same metrical positions within their respective structural phrases. Right side/variety: The "B" VM phrase contrasts melodically with the "A" VM phrase. Also, all of the lyric lines are different. (A) (A) (B)

13. "Loser" (Hansen-Stephenson; REC: Beck)

Meter: Simple quadruple Tempo: Lively (170 BPM) Vocal starts: On beat 1 of bar 1 of the structural phrase Song part: Chorus Wundt curve: Left side/unity: Not much within this 8 -bar period-just the slide guitar riff (ostinato) that repeats every 2 bars behind the vocal. However, this entire 8 -bar period repeats immediately without variation each time it appears. It repeats a total of 8 times in the song. Although 2 VM phrases occupy more than 7 of the 8 bars of the period, VM phrase "A" has only 6 notes. "B" has 12. Two notes in each phrase are held for multiple beats.

"For The Good Times" (Kris Kristofferson)

Meter: Simple quadruple Tempo:  Slow (88 BPM) Vocal starts: Before beat 1 of bar 1 of the structural phrase (anacrusis) Song part: Chorus Wundt curve: Left side/unity: Like "Loser," the VM phrases in "For The Good Times" do not repeat either musically or lyrically. But, of course, the entire period repeats several times during the song. Because of the slow tempo, it takes more than 20 seconds to hear the 15 words of the lyric in this 8 -bar period-about 5 times slower than ordinary conversation.

15. "Come Fly With Me" (Van Heusen-Cahn; REC: Frank Sinatra)

Meter: Combined quadruple Tempo: Moderate (136 BPM) Vocal starts: Before beat 1 of bar 1 of the structural phrase (anacrusis) Song part: Verse Wundt curve: Left side/unity: As with the previous 2 examples, there's little unity within this period, save that the melody of the first part of melodic phrase "B" repeats the first part of "A," sequence-style-although the 2 VM phrases do not form a sequence. However, the third structural phrase (not shown below), repeats VM phrase "A" lyrically (with only slight variation), and also musically, sequence-style. Right side/variety: VM phrases "A" and "B" contrast both musically and

Do the Melodic Techniques Presented in the Next 10 Sections Guarantee EMOTIONALLY POWERFUL TUNES?

Guarantee? Not the way Sadie and Ellie Sue guarantee each horse they sell for five years or 50,000 miles, the best dang guarantee anywhere west of Wichita and north of Amarillo. Get on down to the Dodge City Horse Store before Thursday, make a deal, and they'll extend their guarantee to 6 years or 60,000 miles. Can't beat it with a hickory switch.

Not that kind of guarantee. However, you will find the techniques you are about to learn in evidence in the best work of the greatest, most consistent composers of popular songs: Gershwin, Porter, Rodgers, Kern, Simon, Lennon-McCartney, Dylan, Waits, Hank Sr., Young, Bowie, Mitchell. All of 'em. And in the works of composers such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, and the rest. Regardless of genre, the following techniques and principles of effective melodic composition work. If you learn them and use them, the odds that you will actually produce great tunes, and do it consistently, improve dramatically.

This is not about learning art. It's about learning technique. For practical purposes, think of the relationship between art and technique like this:

Art: Emotional communication via imaginative use of media such as vocal or instrumental sound, body movement, paint on canvas, film projection, etc.

Technique: Manipulative skill with the media used in creating art. As a songwriting artist, you are forever manipulating elements such as melodic and rhythmic components, chord progressions, and various aspects of lyrics, such as rhyme and parallel construction. The more technical skill you have with musical and lyrical elements, the more successful you will be in translating what you imagine and feel into successful real-world art.

You have to master technique before you can expect to hit artistic heights: People make a mistake who think that my art has come easily to me. Nobody has devoted so much time and thought to composition as I. There is not a famous master whose music I have not studied over and over.

You first need to learn how the following techniques work, then become so familiar with them that they get lodged in your skull, in your long-term procedural memory. Like working with circular harmonic scales and other useful techniques covered in Chapters 6, 7, and 8. After a while, you will automatically incorporate them into your songwriting.

If you don't apply the techniques presented in the next ten sections, you will almost certainly not create memorable, convincing melodies. Or only rarely, just by chance-like the great majority of songwriters who, when it comes to composing a tune, have no idea what they're doing.

10 Techniques for Creating Emotionally Powerful Tunes (#1): Don't Let Your Comfort Zone Select Certain Song Elements

### 9.6.1  
Why Pre-Selecting Some Elements Works Better Than Letting Your Comfort Zone SELECT THEM

First, your tune needs to be accessible enough to capture an audience's attention. In measured music, every melody has identifiable metrical characteristics and modal characteristics. That is, every melodic phrase unfolds in time within a milieu of meter, tempo, start point (with respect to a structural phrase), and melodic mode or scale type.

If you write songs randomly, by simply banging away at a guitar or keyboard, letting the metrical and modal characteristics take whatever shape they take, you will find yourself defaulting to a narrow range of metrical and modal characteristics that you find easy to work in, or that you're comfortable with-but that listeners find tedious or muddled. Your personal, boring, confusing comfort zone.

And you will probably compose mediocre tunes that all sound similar, structurally and melodically.

What's the alternative? As guest lecturer Igor Stravinsky remarked at the beginning of Chapter 5, art is organized chaos. So get organized, already.

# 9.6.2

## The Four Pre-Selections

Before you even begin to dream up a tune, make the following four pre-selections. If you incorporate this practice into your songwriting routine, you will keep yourself out of the metrical-modal rut that most songwriters wallow in.

## 1. Pre-select Meter

In measured music, a melody is an irregular rhythmic entity that you can't separate from meter. So, since there's no melody without meter, pre-select a meter before you start composing a tune.

You have seven options:

1. Simple quadruple (the default)
2. Simple triple
3. Compound quadruple
4. Compound triple
5. Combined quadruple
6. Combined triple
7. Irregular

## 2. Pre-select Tempo

Every song proceeds at a certain tempo. So pre-select a specific tempo. Use a metronome and settle on a BPM number. (You can always change itlater.) You have four tempo ranges to choose from (see Section 7.7.3).

1. Slow (60±30BPM)(60±30BPM)
2. Moderate (120±30BPM)(120±30BPM) Default range is 110 to 140 BPM
3. Lively (180±30BPM)(180±30BPM)
4. Fast (240±30BPM)(240±30BPM)

# 3. Pre-select VM Phrase Start Point with Respect to the First Structural Phrase

Since a VM phrase must proceed within a framework of structural phrases, preselect one of the alternatives for starting a VM phrase with respect to beat one of bar one of a structural phrase. Choice of start point is just as important as choice of meter and tempo. A melody is a rhythmic entity, so each type of start point has a different effect on how the melody will ultimately sound (see Section 8.2.5).

You have three choices.

1. Before beat one of bar one (anacrusis, the default)
2. On beat one of bar one
3. After beat one of bar one

If you select either "before" or "after," you don't need to decide exactly how many beats before or after, prior to writing a tune. Just "before" or "after" will do.

## 4. Pre-select Mode or Scale Type

A melody is comprised of a coherent succession of notes that belongs to a group of related tones called scales. Think of scales as belonging to three broad categories. Pre-select one category to work with:

1. Major mode-any major diatonic scale (the default)
2. Minor mode-any minor diatonic scale
3. Some other scale type, such as major or minor pentatonic, blues, or Churchmode (e. g., the Dorian scale)

You don't need to decide on a specific scale. Just decide whether you're going to work in a major key, or a minor key, or some other alternative, such as a Church mode.

### 9.6.3

AIM FOR VARIETY IN YOUR PRE-SELECTION COMBINATIONS

In making your four pre-selections, try to avoid the defaults in two or three of them. Or at least select a combination you've never used in a previous original song.

You won't run out of combinations to pre-select from. Not any time soon. If you multiply out all the choices in the above four characteristics-seven meters, four tempo ranges, three start points, three mode/scale categories-you get 252 possible combinations. You could write a song every week with a different pre-selection combination for almost five years before you'd start repeating them.

If you already have a body of original songs, go through each one and make a note of the combination of "pre-selection" characteristics for each song (even though you did not pre-select them). See how many of your own songs have "default," characteristics. And how many use the same combination of four characteristics, or have three out of four characteristics in common.

# 9.6.4

## Sketch Your Four Pre-Selections on Paper

Once you've made your four pre-selections, draw a little sketch of an eight-bar period-two four-bar structural phrases-on paper (the back of an envelope, so that when you write your first immortal song, you can claim that you scribbled it on the back of an envelope), noting your four pre-selections. Mark the approximate VM phrase start point with an "X." Something like this:

Combined quadruple, 100 BPM, after beat one, major key,

|xx||||
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|||||

Now that you've made your four pre-selections, you'll probably feel comfortable enough to try creating your own tune(s).

But don't do it yet. Instead, go through the next nine techniques, then try the approach to songwriting that follows technique #10.

Prof. Crispin Sartwell's laws come in handy if you're interested in evaluating the quality of a rock band. Maybe your own band ...

Sartwell's First Law: The quality of a rock band is inversely proportional to its pretentiousness. The pretentiousness of a rock band can be expressed as the ratio of its artistic ambition to its artistic accomplishment.

Sartwell's Second Law: The quality of a rock song varies inversely as the square of its distance from the blues. The bluesier the better.

Application of Sartwell's Laws leads to the conclusion that, as a rock band, The Rolling Stones beat The Beatles. The evidence:

- Beginning with Revolver, The Beatles' artistic ambition outweighed the band's artistic accomplishment. Moreover, The Beatles, once a great R & B band, strayed far from the blues tradition.
- The Rolling Stones never aspired to be anything more than a blues-rock band. They did not let artistic ambition get ahead of artistic accomplishment. Further, in all their years of playing, they rarely strayed far from the blues.

According to Sartwell, the application of his two laws yields a short list of the worst rock acts in history: King Crimson, Pearl Jam, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, early U2, and early Bruce Springsteen.

## 10 Techniques for Creating Emotionally Powerful Tunes (#2): Recognize the Primacy of Rhythm Patterns

A melodic phrase has two components: a tune and a rhythm pattern. How important is the rhythm pattern to melodic unity?

Suppose you play a melodic phrase, and then have a choice of playing it a second time either with changes to the rhythm pattern or with changes to the melody.

- If you were to play the same melody with a totally different rhythm pattern, listeners would have a hard time recognizing the second melodic phrase as being related to the first. A major coherence problem.
    
- If you were to retain the same rhythm pattern but change the melody, listeners would easily recognize the second melodic phrase as being related to the first, preserving coherence.
    

# The rhythmic aspect of a VM phrase (or a melodic phrase) plays a central role in creating melodic identity and coherence.

So, when you're working on your own tunes, make an effort to craft unique rhythm patterns. They don't have to be complex, but they need to contrast with the metrical regularity of the underlying structural phrase in order get noticed and make the melody interesting.

Review the rhythm patterns of the VM phrases in the 16 examples in Section 9.5.3. Keep in mind that the starting point of the rhythm pattern with respect to the structural phrase helps determine the character or identity of the rhythm pattern (Section 8.2.5).

## 10 Techniques for Creating Emotionally Powerful Tunes (#3): Use Sequences

Iisa: Play it once, Sam, for old times' sake. Sam: I don't know what you mean, Miss Iisa. Iisa: Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By." -JULIUS EPSTEIN, PHILIP EPSTEIN, & HOWARD KOCH (Casablanca)

If two consecutive ML phrases have the same rhythm pattern, the second is usually related to the first in one of the following six ways:

1. Same melody with the same lyrics
2. Same melody with different lyrics
3. Same melody repeated at a different pitch, with the same lyrics
4. Same melody repeated at a different pitch, with different lyrics
5. Different melody with the same lyrics
6. Different melody with the different lyrics

Humans have inborn sequence recognition. Infants can recognize the same tune played at a different pitch (i.e., the whole melody or phrase, raised or lowered in pitch).

Options 1 and 2 in the above list are common in songwriting, but not as interesting as the other four alternatives. This section discusses options 3 and 4 . Section 9.9 deals with 5 and 6 .

A sequence is a melodic phrase that is repeated at a different pitch. Sequences are exceedingly effective in melody building, although in popular music, you don't hear sequences as much as simple bald melodic repetition ( 1 and 2 above). Like modulation and many of the other 10 techniques in this chapter, the sequence is highly effective but under-exploited because most songwriters don't know what it is or how it works.

- Sequences provide a strong sense of melodic coherence or unity because a whole group of tones - a pattern or melodic unit-is repeated. A sequence is a melodic chunk, instead of a random group of notes.
- Sequences also provide variety because the repetition happens at a different pitch.

One of the beauties of the sequence is that you can use the merest motive of three or four notes and construct an entire verse, chorus, or whole song out of it. This is an ideal to strive for: maximum melodic milage from the fewest possible notes. Unity is assured and, if you apply certain techniques, so is variety. For instance, you can:

- Build leaps into the motive or phrase, ensuring repetition of the leaps at different pitches (technique #5, coming up)
- Build in augmentation and diminution, ensuring their repetition at a different pitch (technique #6)
- Position the motives or phrases metrically so that non-chord tones get metrical position accents, which then get repeated at a different pitch (technique #8)
- If the sequences move upwards in pitch, take the melody to a satisfying climax (technique #10)

Table 69 lists a few examples of songs with sequences:

# TABLE 69 A Smattering of Great Songs with Sequences

|Song|Sequences|
|:--|:--|
|"As Time Goes By"  <br>(Hupfeld)|You must remember this  <br>A kiss is just a kiss  <br>A sigh is just a sigh|

|"Hey Ya" (Outkast)|The first "hey ya" and the second "hey ya" of the chorus form a semisequence. "Hey" is the same pitch in both instances, but "ya" is different. This song is comprised of 6-bar structural phrases, the fourth bar of which has 2 beats instead of 4 . Here's how the 2 VM phrases of the chorus fit the structural phrase:||||||
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
||Bar 1|Bar 2|Bar 3|Bar4|Bar5|Bar 6|
||Hey|ya||Hey|Ya||
||This unusual structural phrase gives the song a unique sound, much different from regular 4-bar phrases with 4 beats to the bar. Repetition of the oddball structural phrase throughout the song, unaltered in both verses and choruses, provides unity. Differing somewhat from the above VM phrases of the chorus is the single VM phrase of the verses, contributing additional variety:||||||

To avoid monotony, it's wise to limit the number of motives or phrases in a sequence to two or three, as in the examples above. Sometimes three pushes the limit. If more, you need to alter the tune to keep if from getting too predictable.

10 Techniques for Creating Emotionally Powerful Tunes (#4): Use the Same Rhythm Pattern with Multiple Melodies

Speaking of altering the tune, melodic rhythm patterns are so memorable that if you repeat the rhythm pattern but completely alter the tune, the listener will perceive charming variety within unity. This is one of the most potent and under-exploited techniques you can use in creating a tune for a song.

Table 70 lists a few examples from the Gold Standard Song List.

# TABLE 70 Rhythm Patterns that Don't Change and Melodies that Do: A Few GSSL Examples

|Song|VM Phrases with Same Rhythm Pattern, Different Melodies|

|"I Got Rhythm" (Gershwin-Gershwin)|I got rhythm  <br>I got music  <br>This song repeats the same rhythm pattern in the middle eight, with new melodies:  <br>Of man trouble  <br>I don't mind him  <br>You won't find him  <br>Round my door|
|"Early Morning Rain" (Lightfoot)|You can work many different melodic phrases into a song if you preserve the identical rhythm pattern. This song has six unique short melodies that share the same rhythm pattern:  <br>In the early mornin' rain  <br>with a dollar in my hand  <br>with an achin' in my heart  <br>and my pockets full of sand  <br>I'm a long way from home  <br>and I miss my loved ones so  <br>There are two more lines ( 7&7& B) that are melodic repetitions of the first two lines.|

## 10 Techniques for Creating Emotionally Powerful Tunes (#5): Mix Up Steps, Leaps, and Repeats

Once a melody gets going, it can move pitchwise in one of three ways:

1. Stepwise (Conjunct) Motion. As you know, a step is a melodic interval of a major or minor second (one or two semitones), either up or down. When melody moves by intervals of a step, it's called stepwise motion or conjunct motion.
2. Leapwise or Skipwise (Disjunct) Motion. Melodic motion by any interval larger than two semitones, either up or down, is variously called leapwise motion or motion by leap or motion by skip or skipwise motion or disjunct motion. Take your pick.
3. Repeated Tone Motion. When a tone simply repeats, even if the next tone is of a different duration, it's called repeated tone motion.

### 9.10.1

## STEPWISE (CONJUNCT) MOTION

Listeners expect a melody to move mainly by steps. Stepwise motion creates melodic cohesion. This is the Gestalt principle of proximity: listeners recognize patterns or threads in sequences of tones that are close together in pitch.

Listeners perceive melodic motion by step as easy and flowing, which is why it's called conjunct motion.

But if conjunct motion goes on for too many steps, it gets monotonous because it becomes too predictable. How many consecutive steps are too many? Four or more in the same direction start to sound like someone practising scale exercises.

As discussed at the outset of this chapter, the pleasure you get from music relates to the emotion that comes of foiling the brain's prediction machinery (surprise!). There are a couple of ways you can mess with your audience's foretelling faculty and make stepwise motion interesting, without sacrificing melodic coherence:

- Don't use tones of the same duration (technique #6, coming up).
- Ensure that some steps include non-chord tones in metrically accented positions (technique #8, coming up).

# 9.10.2

## LEAPWISE (DISJUNCT) MOTION

Leapwise (or skipwise) motion refers to motion in intervals of three or more semitones up or down within a VM phrase, not between VM phrases.

Although leapwise motion is usually termed disjunct, it can sound decidedly conjunct when the melody moves in thirds, using the same tones as the accompanying triads or seventh chords. "The Star Spangled Banner" begins with a sequence of downward and upward leaps. But those leaps (the tones that go with the words, OO-oh say can you see) are mostly thirds that simply follow the chord tones in succession. This is called an arpeggio. Because the tones of the melody do not deviate from the tones of the prevailing chord progression, there's no sense of disjunction, no loss of melodic cohesion.

After the initial leap-filled eight-bar period, which repeats, the remainder of "The Star Spangled Banner" is comprised mainly of steps, with only a few leaps and a few repeated tones.

Leaps wider than a third are perceived as disjunct. They're dramatic-especially leaps upward-because they're unexpected, and unmistakably wider than steps. They create pitch accents. The more leaps, the more excitement.

But, as with steps, there are several ways you can spoil a melody with leaps if you aren't wary:

- Too many consecutive leaps, up and down and up and down, can sound clumsy, disjointed, and incoherent, unless handled carefully (e.g., the verse of "Street Fighting Man," comprised of numerous repetitions of the same perfect-fourth leap, which keeps the tune unified).
- Too many leaps in the same direction can render a tune unsingable if the pitch range becomes too wide.
- A leap to or from a chromatic note may weaken tonality. This does not apply if you're using the modal technique, because all Church mode scales have some chromatic notes. (technique #9, coming up).

Here are four guidelines to keep in mind when you're working on a tune with leaps:

1. Use some leaps-but not too many. Enough to give your melody some drive and energy. But keep in mind that if your tune does not have significantly more steps than leaps, it will usually fail to cohere in your listeners' brains.
2. A leap carries greater melodic weight if it's accompanied by a chord change because the second note of the leap gets a multiple accent:

- The harmony changes at the same moment the melody makes a significant change.
- A chord change usually occurs on a metrically accented beat (metrical position accent)
- The second note of a large leap is usually of longer-than-average duration (agogic accent; technique #6, coming right up)

3. Leaps of thirds, fourths, fifths, and octaves are safe, compared with leaps of sixths, sevenths, and ninths, which elicit stronger emotion, but pose a risk of sounding awkward if not used with a bit of care.
4. After a leap, especially a large leap, it's usually wise, for the sake of melodic cohesion, to"fill in" the pitch gap, mainly with stepwise motion. Filling-in need not proceed immediately after the leap. It can move in waves that gradually fill in. For example, "Over The Rainbow" begins with a dramatic octave leap. By the end of the second measure, the top half of the octave leap is filled in with stepwise motion. But it's not until the second phrase, second measure, that the bottom half of the leap gets filled in.

In "Over The Rainbow," the stepwise filling-in proceeds mainly upwards in pitch, on the words -ver the rainbow and that I heard of. If you reverse these two phrases and sing that I heard of, followed immediately by -ver the rainbow, you have the complete octave leap filled in stepwise-it's the diatonic major scale: do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do.

You can also fill in an upward leap by moving stepwise downwards. Think of ascending and descending a staircase. You can easily leap upwards, several steps at a time. But coming back down, it's prudent to step downwards, one step at a time, or you and your horse will break your necks.

If a leap is small-a leap between chord tones of a triad or seventh chordthen filling in the pitch space after the leap is not necessary for melodic coherence, or at least not as urgent.

# 9.10.3

## REPEATED TONE MOTION

Recall from Chapter 3 that pitch is about the "height" of sound. It's the vertical dimension of music, although it also has a horizontal dimension because it consists of intervals in temporal succession.

Melody is less interesting when successions of intervals do not vary in pitch. Repeated tones are inherently non-melodic. Too many repeated tones tend to retard melodic development. Melody is much more interesting and emotionally compelling when the tune keeps changing direction. The listener's brain has a harder time predicting the next note or series of notes. It's the element of surprise. And surprise elicits emotion.

Most great songs have a small proportion of repeated tones. They usually occur in twos or threes, with alternate tones on metrically weak beats, so that the repetition is not as perceptible. Or they occur in larger groups in fast-tempo songs, which have a high total number of notes, and can handle more repeated tones.

A melody that has a high overall proportion of repeated tones quickly becomes boring and forgettable. When successive notes don't change pitch, there's no tension to resolve. Most songwriters, who have no idea how important it is to keep a melody moving, unwittingly shackle melodies with many noticeable groups of four, five, or more repeated tones, preventing the melody from taking flight.

In a popular song, VM phrases tend to be short, and the melodies are repeated often, even if the lyrics change. So wasting valuable VM phrase time on a lot of repeated tones has the effect of repeating repeated tones, practically guaranteeing melodic monotony.

Inserting more chord changes to make a dull melody interesting does not work as well as changing the direction of the melody. The brain tracks melody more keenly than harmony. Recall from Chapter 6 that melody-free harmony does not stand on its own, but harmony-free melody does (if well-composed). Unlike melody, chords have no inherent upward or downward quality.

## When to Make a Point of Using Repeated Tones

Perils of repeated tone motion notwithstanding, you can make deliberate, effective use of repeated tones in several ways:

1. If you want to focus the listener's attention on the words and rhythm, not the tune, use a lot of repeated tones. All rappers do this, of course. Some great non-rap songs have significant passages of repeated tones, such as U2's "One," "Miss

Otis Regrets," and "One Note Samba." Some songwriters who are famous for the quality of their lyrics have used this technique conspicuously:

- Bob Dylan: "Subterranean Homesick Blues," "The Times, They Are Achangin'," "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue," "Political World"
- Leonard Cohen: "The Future," "Closing Time," "First We Take Manhattan," "Teachers"

2. Groups of repeated tones can work well if sequenced. By repeating a whole group of repeated tones at a different pitch, you effectively chunk the group. Some examples:

- Lennon-McCartney's "Get Back" (verse); "Golden Slumbers" (the repeated line, Once there was a way); many other Beatles tunes with sequenced repeated tones
- Most of the first two VM phrases of the verse of "Born To Be Wild": Get your motor running and Get out on the highway form a sequence, with each phrase comprised mainly of repeated tones
- The first three VM phrases of the verse of "Settin' The Woods On Fire" (see Table 69)

3. Repeated tones sound exciting if the notes are short and fast.

- Bo Diddley's "Who Do You Love?" (verses)
- Lennon-McCartney's"Help!" (verses)
- Hank Snow's "I'm Movin' On"—the first 20 or so notes of each verse

# 9.10.4

Mixing Melodic Motion

To improve your odds of creating a great tune, make a point of:

- Using mostly stepwise motion, but make it interesting, using the techniques discussed in this section.
    
- Including some leaps beyond thirds.
    
- Refraining from using any more than a minimal proportion of repeated tones (remembering that the faster the tempo, the more repeated tones your tune can absorb without getting monotonous), except when you deliberately want to downplay the tune to focus attention on lyrics, or when groups of repeated tones form sequences, or when the tempo is fast and notes short.
    

# 9.11

## 10 Techniques for Creating Emotionally Powerful Tunes (#6): Mix Up Note Values

### 9.11.1

## THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT

If all or most of the notes of a VM phrase are of the same value (duration), the notes tend to match the underlying beat in lock step, which can sound rigid and boring. Once again, not enough variety. Too predictable.

The solution, of course, is to mix up note values. The usual problem is that there are too many notes of short duration, hardly any of long duration. And if there are any long-duration notes, they invariably occur only at the ends of VM phrases.

Here are some ways you can use note values to create melodic interest:

- Start VM phrases on unaccented beats. Every so often, begin and end VM phrases on offbeats, between metrically accented beats. This disrupts the lockstep effect of consecutive equal-value notes.
- Begin a phrase with a long note. Another highly effective technique is to use a note of long duration at or near the beginning of a VM phrase, instead of the usual position at the end. Some examples: "Loser" by Beck (chorus); "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" by U2 (chorus); "Ooh Las Vegas" by Gram Parsons (chorus); "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down," by The Band (chorus); "Moon River" by Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer;

"Smooth Operator" by Sade & R. St. John (chorus-the second "smooth" phrase in each pair); "Golden Slumbers" by Lennon-McCartney (chorus); "Take the 'A' Train" by Billy Strayhorn.

- Use leaps. Leaps are usually notes of longer duration. So if you include some leaps in your tunes, you usually ensure note-value variety. As for notes of short duration, they sound best if they proceed stepwise, or with the occasional small leap of a third or fourth. Short-duration notes that proceed mainly by leap tend to sound choppy and incoherent.

In highly active melodic passages (many short notes per bar), you can contribute to unity by restricting the frequency of chord changes. Conversely, in passages with few notes, but long ones, you can add variety by changing chords more often.

# 9.11.2

## How Melodic Augmentation and DIMINUTION WORK

Augmentation refers to switching from short note values to long note values-usually double the previous note value. Which means the number of notes per bar suddenly decreases by half. Which makes music sound like it has suddenly slowed down.

Diminution is the opposite: switching from long notes to short notes (usually half the previous note value). Which means the number of notes per bar abruptly doubles. Which makes the music sound like it has suddenly sped up.

Both effects capture listener attention because they're unexpected. In popular music, song parts tend to alternate frequently, so augmentation and diminution can be striking. For instance:

- In the Lennon-McCartney song, "Across the Universe," you hear the "slowing down" augmentation effect when the song goes into the Jai Guru Desa chorus, in which the notes are twice as long as the notes of the verse. When the chorus ends and the tune goes into the next verse, you hear the "speeding up" diminution effect, with the number of notes per bar suddenly doubling, compared with the chorus.
    
- The Patty Larkin song, "Who Holds Your Hand?" has the same verse-chorus diminution-augmentation effect as "Across the Universe," only more pronounced.
    
- Same with "Who Do You Love?"
    
- And the Queen song, "We Will Rock You."
    
- The Bee Gees disco anthem, "Stayin' Alive," has several passages of augmentation and diminution in the chorus.
    
- In The Drifters' recording of "Under The Boardwalk," you can hear the augmentation effect going into the chorus, followed by diminution.
    
- Diminution in the middle eight of "Over The Rainbow" provides a refreshing contrast to the long notes of the verses.
    

Like many other powerful techniques, this one is seldom used except by the few songwriters who know what they're doing.

# 9.12

## 10 Techniques for Creating Emotionally Powerful Tunes (#7): Use Modulation

You already know about modulation from Chapter 6 (Sections 6.12 to 6.14). In popular music, modulation's pretty rare (except the ubiquitous Truck Driver's Gear Change), so if you can do it successfully, your song will stand out.

When you modulate, you start out in one key, move to a different key (or keys) and then return to the original key (important!). You become a citizen who goes touring abroad, taking your audience with you. But you do not lose your citizenship just because you cross an international border.

If you modulate going into the chorus, you return in the next verse to the tonality you began with. But the words are different. You have taken your audience back home, but have landed at a different airport. Soon, you all go travelling abroad again, each time returning to a different part of your homeland.

When you successfully modulate, your listeners enjoy an adventure they seldom get in a popular song. Study some of the great modulating songs discussed so far, such as "I Got Plenty O' Nuttin'" and "Street Fighting Man" and "Georgia On My Mind" and "Orange Blossom Special." If you want to write truly great popular songs, you need to learn modulation (except shift modulation). It's not terribly difficult, and it can be extraordinarily effective and memorable.

# 9.13

## 10 Techniques for Creating Emotionally Powerful Tunes (#8): Use Non-chord (Non-harmonic) Tones on Accented Beats

### 9.13.1

## Why Non-Chord (Non-harmonic) Tones on Accented Beats Light Up a Tune

Suppose you're playing the chord C major, which is comprised of the notes C,EC,E, and G. Suppose the tune you're singing only moves among those three notes (in any order). The melody is using chord tones only. This is called consonant harmony.

- Consonant harmony provides strong tonality and is often used at the beginning of a song for that reason-to establish tonality.
- The opening phrase of "The Star Spangled Banner" uses chord tones only.
- With consonant harmony, if you remove the chords altogether, you still get a sense of the harmony, and the tune easily stands on its own.

A non-chord tone (sometimes called a non-harmonic tone), as the name indicates, is a melodic note that does not belong to the prevailing chord. Suppose you continue to play the chord C major, C−E−GC−E−G, but melody uses the notes C,D,EC,D,E, and G . The note D is a non-chord tone. It belongs to the C major scale, but not to the C major chord.

If you were to introduce the note EbEb​ to the melody, still playing the chord C major, then EbEb​ would be a chromatic non-chord tone.

Non-chord tones create dissonance, which disturbs order, creates tension, requires resolution. The surprise of hearing the dissonance of a non-chord tone triggers an emotional reaction in the listener's brain.

If a non-chord tone occurs in an unstressed metrical position, such as the second or fourth beat of a typical 4/44/4 measure, the non-chord dissonance is barely noticed because of the unstressed position.

If the non-chord tone occurs on an accented beat, such as the first or third beat of a 4/44/4 measure, the dissonance sticks out. It gets noticed big time. Such stressed or accented non-chord tones often spell the difference between a great melody and a mediocre one.

Non-chord tones that occur on accented beats create disorder and cause conflict, setting up the inevitable resolution to consonance that restores order. The melody moves from consonant harmony to dissonant harmony, then back to consonant harmony. The melody becomes more memorable and distinct because there is so much emotional tension constantly arising, then being resolved.

A few points to keep in mind about using non-chord tones:

- Consonant chords work best with accented non-chord tones. Just simple majors and minors instead of dissonant chords. Suppose you're playing the dissonant chord C9th, which is comprised of the tones, C, E, G, B5B5​, and D. If the melody then moves to the note D , the dissonant effect is weakened substantially because the chord C9th already contains the note D . There's no surprise when the melody hits that note, even if on an accented beat.
- If a melody is syncopated, the metrical strong-weak effects are reversed or inverted. For example, if a VM phrase starts on the normally weak beat two, then a non-chord tone on beat two will stand out and have a strong dissonant effect.
- Non-chord tones make stepwise motion powerful while preserving melodic coherence. An ordinary major or minor or seventh chord consists of tones in intervals a third apart. So if the melody moves stepwise-in intervals of seconds-it cannot help but create non-chord tones. For example, if the prevailing chord is C major, C−E−GC−E−G, and the melody moves stepwise, E−F−G−A−E−F−G−A− G , then the notes F and A are non-chord tones. But these two notes take on melodic significance only if they occur on strong metrical accents. Otherwise, they're hardly noticed.

A well-placed non-chord tone has such a strong effect because it defies the gravitational pull of the chordal mass. It creates a dissonance, a melodic sparkle or flash.

You will find metrically accented (strong) non-chord tones in the best melodies of Lennon-McCartney, George Gershwin, Cole Porter, Bob Dylan, Hank Williams, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Elton John, Van Morrison, and practically every other outstanding songwriter.

# 9.13.2  
TYPES OF NON-CHORD TONES

Of these main types of non-chord tones, the two types to actively recruit for your tunes are accented neighboring tones (also called appoggiaturas) and suspensions.

## Unaccented Neighboring Tone-Auxiliary (Weak)

When the melody moves from consonance to dissonance to consonance by a semitone or tone and the dissonant note falls on a metrically weak beat, the neighboring tone is called an auxiliary. It's weak. Nearly all songs have auxiliaries.

## Accented Neighboring Tone-Appoggiatura (Strong)

When the melody moves a semitone or a tone from consonance to accented dissonance to consonance, or a phrase begins with an accented dissonant note, then resolves to consonance, the dissonances are accented neighboring tones. These movements may be either upward or downward in pitch.

The first vocal note of the Lennon-McCartney song, "Yesterday," the syllable yes, is an accented (dissonant) neighboring tone-an appoggiatura-that moves down a tone to resolve to a consonance of the prevailing chord (-terday). The same thing happens on far (dissonant) and away (consonant); here (dissonant) to stay (consonant), etc. This song has many accented non-chord tones.

Another example plucked at random from the Gold Standard Song List ... the Talking Heads classic, "Once In A Lifetime." This time, the accented neighboring tone moves up to resolve to prevailing-chord consonance. The chorus begins with the tonic chord ( D major) as the prevailing chord. This chord is comprised of scale degrees 1,3 , and 5 . Melodically, the note on beat one of bar one is scale degree 2 , a non-chord tone, on the word days (and, later in the chorus, the words blue and life-). This dissonance then resolves up to scale degree 3 on the word go (and, in the other lines, the words again and -time).

## Passing Tone (Weak)

A passing tone is just a transitory (weak) dissonant note between a stressed consonant tone of one chord and a stressed consonant tone of the succeeding chord. Practically every tune, great and mediocre, has passing tones.

# Suspension (Strong)

When you hold over a tone that belongs to one chord but not to the next chord in the progression, you have a suspension. The melodic note becomes an accented non-chord tone with respect to the new chord. It stays that way, in a "suspended"sounding state, delaying resolution for a while, then "lets go" of the suspended state. It usually resolves by moving one or two semitones up or down to a tone of the new (prevailing) chord.

In the Preston-Fisher song, "You Are So Beautiful," the same melodic note, scale degree 3, prevails on You are so beaut-. The harmony on You are so is the tonic chord, which contains scale degrees 1,3 , and 5 . So the harmony is consonant up to that point. Then, on the syllable beaut-, the chord changes to IV, comprised of scale degrees 1,4 , and 6 . Since the melody stays on scale degree 3 , the note becomes a suspended non-chord tone. The melody then steps down to scale degree 2 (weak accent), then scale degree 1 (strong accent), resolving the suspension on the syllable -ful.

For an example of a dissonant suspension that steps up to resolve to consonance, have a listen once more to the chorus of the same instructive Talking Heads song, "Once In A Lifetime." At the end of the first bar, the chord is about to change. The prevailing harmony is the tonic chord ( D major), comprised of scale degrees 1,3 , and 5. The melodic note is scale degree 5 (on the words let the). So at this point, there's no dissonance. Then, at the beginning of the next bar, the chord changes to the IV chord (G major), comprised of scale degrees 1,4 , and 6 . But the melody remains on scale degree 5, which is not a note of the IV chord. This creates suspension, an accented non-chord tone (the first beat of the IV-chord bar). On the next beat, the melody moves up to scale degree 6 , which resolves the dissonance.

It would be worth your while to download "Once In A Lifetime" for a buck. Listen to that chorus for the accented neighboring tone and the suspension. Both recur in every line of the four-line chorus. Melodically, repeated use of these two types of non-chord tones is precisely what makes the chorus catchy and memorable.

One final example of a highly effective suspension: Lennon-McCartney's good ol' "Golden Slumbers," a tune that does everything right. At the outset of the chorus, the prevailing chord is the tonic, comprised of scale degrees 1,3 and 5 . The melodic tone, on the word golden, is scale degree 3 , so there's no dissonance. Then, on the syllable slumb-, the chord changes to IV, comprised of scale degrees 1,4 , and 6 , but the melody remains on scale degree 3 , creating a suspension, a dissonant accented non-chord tone. The melody then moves to scale degree 6 , resolving the dissonance by leaping down an interval of a fifth.

# Anticipation (Weak)

An anticipation is the opposite of a suspension. A melodic note is already a nonchord tone, but when the chord changes, the dissonance is resolved. So the nonchord tone "anticipates" its harmonic resolution.

## 10 Techniques for Creating Emotionally Powerful Tunes (#9): Use Modal Scales with Diatonic Chords

### 9.14.1

## How Modal Melody Works

Using Church mode scales with ordinary diatonic triads is yet another powerful but under-utilized technique for creating great melodies-under-utilized, again, simply because few songwriters have any awareness of it.

For reasons discussed in some detail in Chapter 6, Church mode harmony does not work. But Church mode melody against ordinary chords derived from the major and minor modes works well in creating interesting melodies that elicit emotional responses. The reason is that, if you pick a Church mode and stick with it melodically, but use regular major and minor chords for the progression, the tune will end up with chromatic tones. The scale of every Church mode contains one or more chromatic notes with respect to it's diatonic-scale counterpart.

For example...

- Suppose you construct a chord progression using the three principal chords in the key of D major ( D,GD,G, and A 7 ). The notes that make up those chords are: D E F G A B C D.
    
- Now suppose you write a tune using only the notes of the Dorian mode. They are: D E F G A B C D (the white keys on a keyboard, beginning and ending with D).
    
- Two of the notes of the tune, F and C , will clash with the notes of the three principal chords. Those two notes are chromatic-they don't belong to the key of D major.
    

To preserve the Dorian mode feel, it's important to avoid any instances of the notes F#and C#in the melody.

Also, remember that any Church mode scale can use any of the 12 chromatic notes as the tonic note. For example, the Dorian mode scale can begin and end on the note E, provided you preserve the order of tones and semitones that defines the Dorian mode: tone, semitone, tone, tone, tone, semitone, tone. So if you start on the note E, the Dorian scale would be E F# G A B C# D E. And you'd play the chords of E major: E, A, and B7.

If you try this technique, whether with the Dorian or any other Church mode, be careful not to over-use chromatic notes in your melody, or you could undermine allimportant tonality. You may wish to study the songs with modal melodies listed in Section 5.2.4.

# 9.14.2

## Using Parallel Keys Simultaneously

If you use parallel keys simultaneously-the scale of the minor key for melody and the chords of the major key for harmony-you're actually using the modal technique described above. You're using the Aeolian mode, which is now called the minor mode, with major chords. For instance, you could use the scale of A minor (A B C D E F G A) with the chords of A major (A, D, E7). Or the scale of C#minor with the chords of C# major.

Section 6.13.10 provides an example of this technique, which is not uncommon in blues tunes.

## Parallel Keys in "Kiss From A Rose" (Seal)

This exemplary song is worth downloading and studying. It stands out musically for several reasons:

- It's in triple time, not quadruple.
    
- The chords move in powerful second progressions. Yet, except for the middle eight, the song has only three chords, all simple triads.
    
- The most compelling musical characteristic is the use of simultaneous parallel keys. The main chord progression is VI - IV - V - VI, all major chords, including the tonic VI chord, which would normally be VIm. (There's an occasional passing reference to VIm.) Although the harmony is overwhelmingly major, the melody is mostly minor. If you play guitar, clamp your capo on the third fret and play the chord progression E−C−D−EE−C−D−E, with E major being the tonic chord (it would normally be E minor) and the melody mainly using the E minor scale (keyboard chords: G−Eb−F−GG−Eb​−F−G; melody: G minor scale). The parallel minor melody against the major chords creates an arresting, stirring listening experience.

## 10 Techniques for Creating Emotionally Powerful Tunes (#10): Incorporate a (Repeating) Melodic Climax

### 9.15.1

## Melodic Contour and Character

In spoken language, if you want to emphasize something, or get someone's attention, you either raise the pitch of your voice beyond normal level, or you lower the pitch of your voice to create the impression of power.

Similarly, in melody, the highest pitched notes within a sequence of notes attract listener attention. And so do the lowest-pitched notes. They stick out, just as accented non-chord tones stick out.

You can think of melodic phrases as behaving like single elastic strands. As the tune moves up or down in pitch, the elastic is stretched. The higher or lower the melodic phrase extends from equilibrium, the more tension-which, of course, needs to be resolved.

In general, notes that occur on strong beats contribute more to the perception of the direction and shape of a tune than notes that occur on weak beats.

A cohesive melody usually has a curve to it-or, more accurately, a series of little curves and bends that contribute to the overall curve, the melodic contour. It's the contour of a melody that imbues a it with an identity or character that helps make it memorable.

In a popular song, the melodic contour consists of each of the unique VM phrases that make up the verse, chorus, and middle eight, considered collectively. The combined effect of the little melodic curves (a few notes each) is usually to create an overall contour that either rises towards some mid-point, then falls to the end, or, less commonly, the reverse.

# 9.15.2

## Melodic Climax: It's Not Like in the Movies

Somewhere in the contour of a well-structured melody, a melodic climax occurs. But it's not like the formulaic climax of dramatic action in a novel, TV drama, or movie, where the action and conflict steadily climb until there's a climax just before the end. Melodic contours and climaxes don't usually work that way.

- At least one note in each unique VM phrase (i.e., each VM phrase considered without its repetitions) is the highest note of the phrase- whether you try to create a climax or not.
- That climactic high note of a song may occur almost anywhere in a good melodic contour-not only at the end, as in a novel or movie. It may occur in the verse or the chorus or the middle eight. Usually the chorus, often the verse, occasionally in the middle eight.
- The climactic note usually occurs several times in a good melodic contour, not just once-again, unlike the climax of a story. That's because both choruses and verses repeat melodically, even though verses do not repeat lyrically.
- At least one note in every VM phrase is the lowest note of the phrase, again, whether you plan it to be or not. And that note may well serve the same climactic function as the highest note. A fine example is Johnny Cash's original 1956 recording of "I Walk The Line," discussed earlier (Section 6.12.5). When Cash begins the last verse in a low tessitura, tension increases. The listener wonders ... will he or won't he be able to reach that low, low note coming up?

Because of the comparative brevity of VM phrases, one VM phrase may have several occurrences of its highest note, but the next VM phrase in the same period may then have only one or two occurrences of its highest note, which, if higher than the highest note of the first VM phrase, serves as a melodic climax of the period.

For example, in the first eight bar period of each verse of Dylan's "Like A Rolling Stone," the first VM phrase (contained within the first four-bar structural phrase) has about ten occurrences of the phrase's highest note. But the second VM phrase has only two (on the words, didn't you?), which are higher than the highest notes of the first VM phrase. Melodic climax in this case works within an eight-bar period, instead of within a four-bar phrase.

But didn't you is not the song's melodic climax. That occurs in the chorus, on the first iteration of the word feel, as in How does it feel? On the word feel, the chord is the tonic chord, comprised of scale degrees 1,3 , and 5 . But the word feel occurs on scale degree 4 , the highest note of the song, on beat one of bar one of the chorus (the words how does it constitute a three-note anacrusis). So it's an accented non-chord tone. That's why that particular note sticks out. It does not recur in the remainder of the chorus, so it functions as the melodic climax. (The same note does appear elsewhere, but not in the form of a non-chord tone on an accented beat, so in those instances, it does not have a climactic effect.) Moreover, that high scale-degree-4 climactic note does not resolve to a consonant note, which makes it stand out even more.

# 9.15.3

## No Need to ObSESs About Where to Position THE CLIMAX

In a popular song, the climactic note (or notes) occurs several times-every verse or every chorus. That's why it's not necessary to worry about carefully placing the climactic note at the end of a verse or chorus. You don't have to plot melodic climax the way a scriptwriter plots a dramatic climax. In "Like A Rolling Stone," the climax occurs at the beginning of the chorus-not at the end.

In Jerome Kern's "The Way You Look Tonight," the first note of the second eight-bar period is a higher note than any of the notes in the first eight-bar period, and serves as the climactic note of the 16 -bar verse. And that note occurs smack in the middle of the verse (bar nine, beat one)-not at the end.

In "The Star Spangled Banner," the tune reaches the climactic note in two places, once in the middle of the tune on the words red glare, and again near the end on the word free.

# 9.15.4

## SAturation Tones Dissipate MElodIC TENSION

A listener's brain will register the highest and lowest notes of a VM phrase as standout notes. They create tension that gets resolved. But too many instances of the highest or lowest note in one phrase may dilute the climactic quality.

In creating original tunes, watch out for a saturation tone. Such a tone, as the name suggests, keeps recurring in a melodic phrase. A saturation tone makes a tune boring (far left side of the Wundt curve). It often occurs in what would otherwise be a climactic position.

So you need to be aware of the number of times the highest (and lowest) tone occurs in each unique VM phrase. If it's more than once or twice, you may need to edit out some repetitions of those highest or lowest notes so that the climactic effect does not get diluted.

### 9.15.5

## Melismas May Dissipate Melodic Tension, TOO

Melismas were discussed briefly in Section 3.1.4. A melisma is a sung syllable that varies in pitch. Sometimes all over the place. You can think of an ostentatious melisma as the opposite of a saturation tone. Gymnastic melismatic improvisation is a specialty of some expressive singers.

Alas, if a singer specializing in wild melismatic improv isn't careful, he or she can end up blurring a fine melody, obscuring its identity, and dissipating the tension required for an audience to perceive the melodic climax.

This does not usually apply to a great singer's melismatic interpretation of a wellknown song. The singer can take liberties with the melody because the audience already knows the tune as it was originally composed. Many of the immortal jazz and R & B artists have made effective use of melisma technique to create dazzlingly original interpretations of classic songs.

But when a song is new, unknown to an audience, intricate melismas that an unwary singer uses to embellish the tune end up defining the melody instead, in the minds of listeners-not simply embellishing the melody. With the singer effectively recomposing the tune on the fly, the odds of the original melodic curve and climax surviving are slim. The audience never hears the original tune, but instead hears a

melody that's complex and confusing, given the limits of short-term memory (far right side of the Wundt curve). The tune does not stick.

## Putting It All Together: A Suggested Approach to Composing Tunes

### 9.16.1  
If the Net's Down, There's No Structure, No COMPREHENSION ... AND No EMOTIONAL CONNECTION

I'd just as soon play tennis with the net down. —ROBERT FROST

That's how Frost dismissed free verse. His comment fits the art of songwriting perfectly. You cannot write great songs unless you have the net up-a willingness to learn, and play by, the "rules," the composition techniques that make a tune intelligible and enable emotional communication.

A song exists in time, not in space, so it absolutely must reveal discernable structure and patterning as it unfolds, second by second, minute by minute. If it doesn't, listeners will not be able to make sense of it, remember it, and connect with it emotionally.

Lennon and McCartney, Irving Berlin, and other "musical illiterates" knew an awful lot of composition technique. By the time they hit their stride as songwriters, they knew most or all of the technical material discussed in this book (particularly in Chapters 6 through 10). When they came up with ideas or fragments that might work out as songs, they applied their technical know-how and turned those ideas and fragments into fully-realized brilliant songs.

The evidence of the technical expertise of great songwriters such as Irving Berlin and Lennon-McCartney and is right there in the songs-in the recordings and in the sheet music transcriptions.

By contrast, 99.9%99.9% of aspiring songwriters are clueless about effective composition technique. Which is why nearly all songwriters turn out only generic, mediocre, forgettable songs. And that includes songwriters with Billboard hits.

It doesn't matter how intelligent you are. It doesn't matter how imaginative you are. It doesn't matter how many songs you've already written. It doesn't matter how hard you've worked on your music. It doesn't matter how well you can sing or play an instrument. It doesn't matter how good you are with computers and recording gear. It doesn't matter whether or not you come from a musical family. It doesn't matter whether or not you can read or write music. If you don't become skilled in composition technique, you will rarely or never write a single brilliant song.

Each of the greats who wrote a body of classic songs had one thing in common: technical mastery-an understanding of intervals, chords, progressions, pulse types, meter, tempo, rhythm, vocal-melodic phrase, structural phrase, binary form, melodic coherence, melodic and harmonic cadence, and the various techniques for making tunes effective and compelling.

You or anybody else with an imagination who takes the time to master these technical elements and apply some imagination can become a great songwriter.

What follows is a suggested approach to composing original songs. It's based on everything covered so far in this book.

- In this approach, you start with the music and work your way into the lyrics.
- Section 10.14, towards the end of the next chapter, discusses the reverse approach-starting with lyrics meant for a melodic setting, or lyrics meant for rapping, then adding the beats, tunes, harmonies and other musical elements.

# 9.16.2

## Where to BEGIN? With Pre-SELECTIONS

A first step to learning how to compose original, coherent, emotionally compelling tunes is to spend some time becoming confident working with the four "preselection" song elements. This will get you out of the habit of slipping into your comfort zone-playing with the net down. It will require you (force you!) to gain an understanding of aspects of meter, tempo, rhythm, and mode that you've never tried in your songwriting.

Go back to Section 9.5.3. Each of the 16 examples lists the song's meter, tempo, and VM phrase start point. You probably know most of the melodies. You can learn the ones you don't know from the 30 -second excerpts at download sites such as iTunes or PureTracks or any other such site.

The 16 songs in Section 9.5.3 are sequenced such that there's a lot of variety from one song to the next. As an exercise, go through the following steps with all 16 songs.

1. Whip out your pocket digital recorder. If you don't have one, get one. They don't cost much. A mini recorder will save you a ton of time. And it will enable you to capture melodic and lyrical ideas that flow capriciously into, and irretrievably out of, your short-term memory.

# "I CAN'T GET NO ... ZZZZZ"

Keith Richards woke up one morning in 1965 with the "Satisfaction" guitar riff in his head. Fortunately he had a habit of keeping a cassette recorder by his bed. So he grabbed a guitar, taped the riff, and went back to sleep, forgetting to turn the machine off. "On the tape you can hear me drop the pick," he explained in a Rolling Stone magazine interview. "The rest of the tape is snoring." 2. Whip out your digital or mechanical metronome (or other beat-making device). If you don't have one, get one. Like a pocket recorder, a metronome is an essential tool for a songwriter. 3. Go to Section 9.5.3, Song 1, "Space Oddity." Note that the meter is simple quadruple and the VM phrase start-point is after beat one, bar one of the structural phrase. The tempo is slow- 65 BPM. Set the metronome going at 65 BPM, at a volume level that the recorder will be able to capture. NOTE: If you have a metronome or other digital device that can be programmed to do any number of fancy rhythmic things-resist the temptation. Just set it to sound like an ordinary metronome: single audible beats or clicks at the indicated tempo, nothing more. 4. Switch the recorder on, do a verbal count-in, and hum or sing syllables to the tune that goes with the lyric, Ground control to Major Tom. Don't sing the words. Instead, use a syllable to voice the notes of the tune-"dah-dah-dah-dah"-or whatever syllable you're comfortable with. For now, you're simply learning a technique for capturing a discernable tune-not lyrics-in a recorded medium.

After going through the 16 songs, if you feel you aren't completely confident working with pre-selected elements, keep at it, using classic songs (not obscure or unrecorded songs) of your own choosing. For each song, draw an eight-bar period diagram:

|||||
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|||||

- Ascertain the meter; use the list in Section 9.6.2
- Use your metronome to get the tempo
- Locate the first VM phrase start-point with respect to the structural phrase
- Determine the mode
- Shade in the VM phrases, as in Section 9.5.3 (With some songs, structural phrases may be longer or shorter than four bars. If so, you'll need to adjust your diagram accordingly.)

# 9.16.3

## Next: Original Rhythm Patterns

Once you're satisfied you know how to handle pre-selections, focus on creating original rhythm patterns:

- Start by doing four pre-selections. Review Section 9.6.4, which has an example, including an eight-bar sketch. Use that one, or do one of your own.
- When you're ready to compose, don't work on melody right away. Instead, work on rhythm patterns. As previously mentioned, rhythm is the soul of melody. So focussing on rhythm patterns will get you thinking about how much a unique rhythmic scheme contributes to the appeal of a captivating, memorable tune (recall, for example, Gershwin's "I Got Rhythm" rhythm pattern). An interesting rhythm pattern gives a melody identity and helps make it more memorable. Syncopation-pitch accents on metrically weak beats-makes melody more memorable. But if the rhythm pattern is too complex, it becomes less memorable (Wundt curve!).
- With the metronome going, and with a count-in (important!), start recording raps-without melody-of irregular rhythm patterns. No words-just use a syllable of your choosing. Any pattern will do except the strict 1-2-3-4 of the underlying beat. The skill you're working on is fitting original rapped, rhythmic phrases into eight-bar periods.
- Leave spaces between the rapped phrases roughly every five to ten syllables.

Two of the biggest preventable mistakes you can make are:

1. Creating long or convoluted rhythm patterns; and

# 2. Creating too many different rhythm patterns for one song.

A few short phrases that repeat work much better than waves of long phrases that nobody can remember. If you ever doubt this, review again the 16 songs in Section 9.5.3, and the summary table following song 16.

- With each take you record, stick with your pre-selected elements, at least until you've recorded a few samples. (Songwriting takes discipline. Whips, chains, dog collars.) Always do a count-in, and always start your first phrase in the pre-selected position with respect to beat one of bar one of the structural phrase. When you listen to the playback, your vocal count-in and your eightbar sketch will orient you to where the phrases are located within the eight-bar period, even though there's no instrumental accompaniment except the metronome.

Try the above with a variety of pre-selection sets, not just one. Work at it until you're satisfied and confident that you can create original raps of rhythm patterns within the parameters of any set of pre-selected elements (except scale type, which is irrelevant at this stage).

### 9.16.4

## Next: Original Melodic Phrases-No Lyrics (Yet)

Now you can use the same approach to work out original melodic phrases. At this stage, with melody in the picture, you may want to go back and review the " 10 Techniques for Creating Emotionally Powerful Tunes" discussed in this chapter.

A few suggestions for working on your original melodic phrases:

- Resist the temptation to use lyrics. Not yet. (That's next.) The idea at this stage is to focus on creating original, coherent melodic phrases that fit within eightbar period structure.
- Don't use a musical instrument to record your original tunes. Use your voice with a syllable of your choice. The human voice is far more expressive than any musical instrument. Using your voice will also prevent you from creating impossible-to-sing-but-easy-to-play melodic phrases.
- Now's the time to grab your guitar or sit down at your keyboard (finally). Be aware that you will probably find yourself playing only the chord changes

you're already completely familiar with. Which can cause you to slip dangerously into boring old Comfort Zone Land.

On the other hand, using a guitar or keyboard will enable you to efficiently do melodically creative things:

- Recognize opportunities to insert accented non-chord tones
- Work out the placement of cadences
- Experiment with modulation
- Experiment with multiple melodies using the same rhythm pattern
- Work out chord progressions for sequences

# 9.16.5

## Next: Original VM Phrases (Words and MUSIC)

It's likely you have some lyrics kicking around, maybe some lyrics you haven't set to music yet. If you have no lyrics except those to which you've already set music, start fresh. Scribble out some new lyrics. You may want to read Chapter 10 first. If you're stuck, use a poem. (It's been said that you can sing any of Emily Dickinson's poems to the tune of "The Yellow Rose Of Texas." Try it!)

## Pre-selections and Set-up

Once you've settled on a lyric, do your four pre-selections, based on the feel you think would suit the lyric.

1. Meter. Is the lyric more suited to quadruple or triple meter?
2. Tempo. What speed would suit the words? Use a metronome and experiment with fast and slow and moderate tempo settings as you go over the words until you settle on a tempo that feels right.
3. VM phrase start-point. Should the first VM phrase start before, on, or after beat one of bar one of the structural phrase?
4. Mode or scale type. Would the lyric work best in a major key, a minor key, or a Church mode?

Draw an eight-bar diagram on the back of a coffee- or wine-stained envelope (of course) and jot down your pre-selections.

Next, on a printout or copy of the lyrics, mark or underline the accented syllables of all the words. This will help you avoid the awkwardness that comes of failing to adhere to the Accent-matching Law when setting words to music (Section 8.2.6).

Now you're ready to start composing with words. But first ... you will probably want to review the summary information in Table 68, And also, the summary information at the ends of Chapters 7, 8, and 9 (Section 9.17). You won't remember everything until you've gone over the material in this book many times. Eventually it'll sink into your long-term procedural memory.

# Rapping and Accent-matching

Next, with metronome and recorder going (and remembering to do a count-in with each take), work out rhythm patterns for a couple of lines of the lyric. Never mind melody for the moment. Just rap the lyrics until you've got the structure and rhythm worked out. Then pencil the lyrical phrases into your diagram where they occur in the eight-bar period. Pay attention to lyrical accents and keep the dang Accent-matching Law in mind: if metrical and verbal accents don't coincide, the lyric will sound awkward and amateurish.

Now you're finally ready to add melody and chords. You've got the melodic rhythm pattern(s) worked out. You've remembered not to make the phrases too long (only a few words each). And you've left sufficient space between the phrases.

Since you're now about to put all the elements together, including chords, a review of Chapter 6 on chords and chord progressions might be in order. Especially Table 51 and the chord progression guidelines at the end of the chapter.

## Adding Melody and Harmony

If you have an exceptional memory for harmony, you might find it easier to work without a guitar or keyboard and work out the harmony in your head. Otherwise, use a guitar or keyboard for the reasons listed a couple of pages ago.

Switch on your recorder and metronome and start setting melodies to words, using your four pre-selections and the rhythm patterns you've already worked out.

Use the Chord Progression Chart for reference (Appendix 1), and keep in mind the strengths and weaknesses of fifth, third, second, and chromatic progressions.

When composing like this, stick with four-bar structural phrases and eight-bar periods until you're completely comfortable and confident about working with shorter or longer structural phrases and periods.

You'll probably find it easier to come up with melodic phrases that have character and coherence if you close your eyes. Visual perception occupies a large amount of

your brain's attention and your short-term memory. Getting rid of all that distracting information by closing your eyes while you're composing may enable you to focus more easily and imaginatively on the imagery of the lyrics, and on melodic and harmonic patterns. (Composers and songwriters often report that they wake up from a dream state with a great tune in mind.)

Expect your initial efforts to not turn out terribly well. It will take you some time to work through, understand, and absorb into long-term memory all the technical stuff in the last half dozen chapters or so. It's a lot of material, and it'll take you more than a few weeks (or months) to grasp it all.

Your first efforts may have any number of musical weaknesses such as:

- Few or no non-chord tones on accented beats
- Lyrics that defy the Accent-matching Law and sound silly
- Too many unique (unrepeated) VM phrases
- VM phrases that run on too long
- No discernable melodic climax
- Not enough leaps, or too many leaps
- Too many instances of pointless repeated tones
- Not enough note value variety
- Not enough space between VM phrases
- Not enough strong chord progressions
- Not enough cadences involving the V chord

Eventually, you'll develop good composition habits and automatically avoid weaknesses such as those listed above. And, if you have the imagination, you will be able to write great songs at will, with or without the approach suggested in this section.

MUSIC FIRST, OR LYRICS?

Once you understand composition technique, it doesn't matter. Whether you start with music or with lyrics, if you know musical and lyrical composition technique, you'll know how to shape the elements into a focussed, coherent, emotionally powerful song. If you don't know technique, it doesn't matter whether you start with music or lyrics. You'll turn out an unfocused, incoherent, forgettable song.

## SAIL HORSING

Take most people, they're crazy about cars. I'd rather have a goddamn horse. A horse is at least human, for God's sake. -J. D. SALINGER

Before moving on to Chapter 10, why not take a break and do some recreational sail horsing to clear your mind? Never heard of sail horsing? No wonder. It's a relatively new recreational activity.

In Chapter 1, you learned that, if you whisper the right things in your horse's ear, you can lead him (or her) to water and get him (or her) to float on his (or her) back.

Recreational "sail horsing" exploits this phenomenon. As you know, when floating on their backs, horses point their legs straight up. You can use their legs as little masts and secure sails to them. They don't mind. There's a place in Oregon called the Columbia River Gorge that has strong steady winds most days-excellent for sail horsing. The nearby town of Hood River

has several good sail horsing supply shops where you can get sails for any horse leg size, live shoulder parrots, eye-patches, and such. They'll even supply you with horses on a rental basis, which they have shipped to Oregon all the way from the Dodge City Horse Store.
