title:  " What Music REALLY Is, Who Makes It, Where, When, Why"

Information is not knowledge. Knowledge is not wisdom. Wisdom is not truth. Truth is not beauty. Beauty is not love. Love is not music. Music is the best. —FRANK ZAPPA

### 1.0.1

## PIQUING THE POLARIZED

Chapter 1 addresses these five basic questions about music:

1. [ЧТО]({% post_url 2025-01-08-what %}) музыка вообще такое
2. [КТО]({% post_url 2025-01-09-who %}) придумал музыку
3. [ГДЕ]({% post_url 2025-01-10-where %}) возникла музыка
4. [КОГДА]({%  post_url 2025-01-11-when %}) пояявилась музыка
5. [ПОЧЕМУ/ЗАЧЕМ]({% post_url 2025-01-12-why %}) вообще существует музыка

The other question, "HOW does one go about creating music worth listening to?" takes nine chapters to answer-Chapters 3 through 11, the main part of the book.

Tackling the five "Ws" of the phenomenon of music necessitates delving into Darwinian natural selection and sexual selection. If you have a strong religious faith,

you may find bits of Chapter 1 offensive because of all the evolution stuff. On the other hand, if you have a strong atheistic belief, Chapter 1 may offend you, too, because it does not advocate for atheism.

If you already know all about natural selection and sexual selection and brain modularity, then Chapter 1 might simply bore you. If so, why not grab a bag of chips and ride on ahead to Chapter 2, which discusses the rise of the Western popular music industry and its various genres. Or Chapters 3 through 11, the sections on how to create memorable, emotionally powerful music and lyrics.
