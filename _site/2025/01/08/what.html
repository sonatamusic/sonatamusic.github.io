  <h1>Что такое Музыка?</h1>

<h2 id="biological-not-mystical">BIOLOGICAL, NOT MYSTICAL</h2>

<p>Music has played a central role in human existence for hundreds of thousands of years.</p>

<p>So…what is music? According to the evidence, it’s probably an adaptation-although some researchers argue music is a byproduct of other adaptations.</p>

<p>What’s an adaptation? It’s a biological trait that evolved to promote survival or reproductive success. A tiger’s fangs. A peacock’s fan. A mosquito’s ability to draw blood and escape into the night, just as you’re trying to get to sleep.</p>

<p>As a human, you possess many formidable adaptations, such as bipedalism (twolegged walking), language, and a lot of other inborn skills that your fellow primates do not have. (Unlike horses, all primates - several hundred species-have highly flexible 5 -fingered hands, opposable digits, and sharp eyesight. Some, such as monkeys, apes, and humans, also have relatively large brains.)</p>

<p>Before biologists confer “adaptation” status upon a human trait, in a solemn ceremony at Stonehenge under a full moon, said trait must fulfil several criteria, among them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Humans in all present-day cultures must use the adaptation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidence from history and anthropology must indicate the adaptation’s existence in ancient cultures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evidence from palaeontology must indicate the adaptation’s existence to some degree in extinct hominid species-that is, in other species of bipedal human-like primates, all now extinct.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All of the above apply to language and bipedalism. They also apply to music. Every human culture ever known has had music. Even societies that do not have well-developed visual arts show sophisticated musical development.</p>

<p>Today, practically all normal adult human beings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Can and do sing to some degree (Pop Idol/American Idol contestants notwithstanding), even if only in the privacy of an elevator or on the back of a horse in the hills south of Tulsa.</li>
  <li>Can and do tap at least one foot to a tune, once in a while (an important qualification as you’ll see in a minute).</li>
  <li>Listen to self-chosen music, purchase music, and otherwise show appreciation for music at some level. (“I could’ve played guitar like Jimi, but I chose to go into accounting instead, to meet more women.”)</li>
</ul>
