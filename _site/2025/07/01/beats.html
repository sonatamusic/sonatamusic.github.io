<p>Music is the pleasure the human mind experiences from counting without being aware that it is counting. -GOTTFRIED LEIBNIZ All right, you cats been talkin’ ‘bout you got rhythm. You got this and you got that. I got rhythm! I’m gonna see what you all got. -LOUIS ARMSTRONG</p>

<h3 id="711">7.1.1</h3>

<h2 id="where-rhythm-comes-from-the-time-keeper-in-your-brain">WHERE RHYTHM COMES FROM: THE TIME-KEEPER IN YOUR BRAIN</h2>

<p>Your brain’s evolved mechanisms for coordinating and synchronizing movement enable you to walk, jog, run, jump, dance, and tie your horse to a hitchin’ post-all</p>

<p>tasks that require sophisticated coordination. When disease or injury disrupts your brain’s time-keeping system, you experience motor impairment (multiple sclerosis, for example).</p>

<p>Music and language both require elaborate time-keeping. They parallel each other rhythmically. Rhythmic motion is an important element in mother-infant communication, indicating a linkage between rhythm and the other elements of music in the evolutionary origin of music-making.</p>

<p>In modern humans, bodily movement typically accompanies song: head nodding, tapping, clapping, dancing, swaying. It’s the rule, not the exception. It’s unusual to listen to a musical performance that has a pronounced rhythmic element without participating to some degree in the rhythmic flow.</p>

<h1 id="712">7.1.2</h1>

<h2 id="evolutionary-perspectives-on-the-auditory-system-sense-of-balance-vestibular-system-bipedalism-and-locomotion-in-humans">Evolutionary Perspectives on the Auditory System, Sense of Balance (Vestibular SYSTEM), BIPEDALISM, AND LOCOMOTION IN HUMANS</h2>

<p>The human brain has a general coordinating mechanism that links everything required for speech and music-making-auditory and visual information, motor channels, timing.</p>

<p>Your vestibular system, which controls balance, connects physically to your inner ear. Rhythmic control of balance and body movements required for bipedal locomotion was in place before the evolution of the rhythmic element of musicmaking (vocal music and dance).</p>

<p>Walking, jogging, and running require an inborn clock for coordination. If you walk any distance, you usually set a rhythmic pace: each step takes an equal amount of time. Same with jogging and running. You can think of dancing as fancy jogging or running in place, and in sync with other jogger-dancers.</p>

<p>As discussed in Chapter 1, the capacity for rhythmic entrainment is an evolved trait exclusive to humans. A baby enjoys a much richer musical and bonding experience when Mom bounces or rocks baby rhythmically to music, compared to simply having music played for baby in the crib. Enjoyment of the direct experience of music carries over from infancy to childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. People tend to prefer attending live music events that encourage or at least tolerate audience entrainment, compared with events at which audiences are expected to sit quietly and be still while the musicians play.</p>

<p>Your Brain’s Evolved Memory Functions</p>

<p>Everything in life is memory, save for the thin edge of the present. -MICHAEL 5. CAZZANICA</p>

<h3 id="721">7.2.1</h3>
<p>MUSIC AND MEMORY LIMITATIONS</p>

<p>To comprehend and appreciate music, you have to remember sequences of events such as chord changes, melodic phrases, riffs, lyric lines, and so on. Music unfolds in time, bit by bit, unlike other art forms such as painting, which you can grasp as a whole, without having to hold some of it in memory over time. On a time-space continuum of the arts, music is at one extreme, painting at the other:</p>

<p>Alas, unlike computer memory, human memory has severe natural limitations. Nowhere is this more evident than in music. Humans can remember only a few recent musical events without reference to previously-heard events. The brain’s shortterm memory buffer is limited in capacity to only a handful of items and a time span of only a minute or so.</p>

<p>Because of human memory limitations, each element of music needs to be inherently repetitive. Beat. Chord changes. Motives. Riffs. Melodic phrases. Verses. Choruses.</p>

<p>Short-term memory limitations render overly complex music incomprehensible. Songwriters and composers who don’t understand this find themselves with vanishingly small audiences.</p>

<p>If you write music that has a lot of novel (i.e., unrepeated) melody, or numerous changes in meter, or no discernable tonality, then prospective listeners will turn away, irritated, unable to find any meaningful patterns that might provide something approximating an enjoyable musical experience.</p>

<h2 id="short-term-and-working-memory">SHORT-TERM AND WORKING MEMORY</h2>

<p>Every composer knows the anguish and despair occasioned by forgetting ideas which one has not time to write down. —HECTOR BERLIOZ</p>

<p>When you recall something from memory, you actually reconstruct the memory. You don’t retrieve it, the way you retrieve a file from a cabinet or from a “folder” on your computer. Each time you reconstruct a memory, it’s a bit different. You may think you’re certain something happened the way you recall it, but that ain’t the case. As discussed in Chapter 1, you remember the gist, not the exact details, even if you think you remember the exact details.</p>

<p>Your brain does not have a single “memory processor,” nor a single memory storage area. There are several kinds of memory, and your brain stores memories in many places.</p>

<p>Short term memory is limited in capacity to about seven items, plus or minus two. (Using sign language, the number is only about five.) It’s limited in duration to a minute or less. What you hold in short-term memory is always being over-written. (Why did the Post-It note become phenomenally successful? It enables you to capture on paper a small amount of information currently in your short-term memory, before it gets over-written.)</p>

<h2 id="change-blindness-gorilla-what-gorilla">CHANGE BLINDNESS: GORILLA? WHAT GORILLA?</h2>

<p>Thanks to short-term memory limitations, focussing your attention on one thing in your environment causes you to fail to notice other things, even if they’re happening literally right under your nose. The psychologist Daniel Simons and his colleagues refer to this phenomenon as “change blindness.”</p>

<p>Picture this. A stranger stops you to ask for directions. You and the stranger talk for 10 or 15 seconds. Then two workmen carrying a door walk between you and the stranger. After the workmen pass by, the stranger is a different person. The new stranger is wearing different clothes, is different in height, and has a different sound to his voice. What are the odds that you will notice that the person you are now talking to is actually a different person from the one you were talking to before the workmen carrying the door walked through?</p>

<p>Only about 50-50. Daniel Simons and his colleagues have conducted numerous other experiments, replicated by other researchers, demonstrating change blindness due to short-term memory limitations. The gorilla experiment, for example. A group of people are watching a video of an informal basketball game. They’re instructed to count the number of passes made by one of the teams. Partway through the game, a woman in a gorilla suit strolls into sight among the basketball players. She even stops, faces the camera, and thumps her chest before moving out of the picture. Altogether, the gorilla is clearly visible for nine seconds. Viewers of the video who are not instructed to count passes all report that they noticed the gorilla. But half or more of those instructed to count passes are so focussed on that task that they fail to notice the gorilla.</p>

<p>You can see the gorilla video and other change blindness demos at this website: <a href="http://sising.berkman.uluc.edu/djs_lab/demos.html">http://sising.berkman.uluc.edu/djs_lab/demos.html</a></p>

<h1 id="the-phonological-loop">The Phonological Loop</h1>

<p>One aspect of short-term memory enables you to overcome these limitations to some degree through repetition. This is called the phonological loop. It’s only good for about five seconds’ worth of information, which you have to keep repeating. For example, you can look up an unfamiliar number in the phone book and keep repeating it to yourself until you actually dial the number. Once you dial the number and the phone conversation starts, your short-term memory becomes occupied with the demands of the conversation, and the phone number fades forever. And you won’t be able to recall it because you did not commit it to long-term memory. If you need the number again, you have to look it up. Dang.</p>

<p>With enough repetition, something you hold in short-term memory, such as a phone number, can become encoded in long-term memory.</p>

<p>That applies to songs. Which is exactly why songs need so much repetition. With a single exposure to a new song that typically includes several repetitions of a verse and chorus, a listener retains a small bit of the tune and lyrics. The gist of it. Only after many exposures to the entire song will the listener have the whole melody and lyric encoded in his or her brain.</p>

<h1 id="working-memory">Working Memory</h1>

<p>Working memory encompasses short-term memory and other memory-related functions. Working memory is sometimes called working attention because it refers not only to what you can hold in short-term memory, but also to how you can use the information, including information you can summon from long-term memory.</p>

<p>Working memory involves the concept of attention-your ability to repress irrelevant stimuli and focus on enabling stimuli and information. That includes whatever is important in your immediate environment that is not stored in your longterm memory, plus recollections you bring into your working memory as needed. All the while, though, your short-term memory buffer limits what you can do without looking up information recorded in notes or books or images or other stored data.</p>

<h2 id="short-term-memory-and-gambling-machines">SHORT-TERM MEMORY AND GAMBLING MACHINES</h2>

<p>Horse sense is the thing a horse has which keeps it from betting on people. -W. C. FIELDS</p>

<p>The psychopaths who program electronic slot machines know exactly how to exploit the limitations of short-term memory. They deliberately set up the machines so that the player experiences a high proportion of near misses, deceiving the player into thinking the odds of winning are much much higher than they actually are. If the machine has a ‘stop’ button, the player is duped into thinking he or she has some control over where the spinning reels halt. In fact, the outcome is electronically determined the moment the player pushes the spin button. The ‘stop’ button is utterly fraudulent, designed only to speed up the rate at which the player loses money.</p>

<p>Gambling machines are programmed to keep the player hooked with near misses and small wins. The player wins small sums frequently enough that he or she forgets the long trend: steady losses. Within the span of short-term memory, it always seems as though the machine is paying off and could cough up a jackpot at any moment. The conned player loses track of time and money, and eventually walks away busted.</p>

<p>The larcenous swindlers who run casinos and other gambling businesses concoct euphemisms such as “gaming entertainment” to put a friendly face on the cheat-machine industry.</p>

<h1 id="723">7.2.3</h1>
<p>“Chunking” to the Rescue (More or Less)</p>

<p>You can remember only about seven items at once. But if you group related items into larger units, your short-term memory treats those units as individual items, which frees up your working memory to admit more information-up to a point. Such grouping is called chunking. (It’s the reason phone numbers and credit card numbers are separated into groups of three and four.)</p>

<p>You could pretty easily remember a series of five random letters of the alphabet by repeating them in a phonological loop. You’d have a much harder time remembering 45 random letters because the phonological loop is limited to only a few seconds. But you could easily memorize 45 letters if they took the form of five random words, each consisting of nine letters.</p>

<h2 id="in-practically-every-aspect-of-music-including-lyrics-chunking-plays-an-central-role">In practically every aspect of music, including lyrics, chunking plays an central role.</h2>

<p>As you’ll see shortly, your brain automatically chunks (groups) a steady sequence of discrete beats into larger units called pulses. Pulses chunk into still larger units called bars or measures, which chunk into still larger structural units (the subject of the next chapter).</p>

<p>But chunking has its limits. People find it much more difficult to remember a 15minute symphonic movement or a 50 -minute symphony, no matter how wellchunked it is, compared with a three-minute popular song.</p>

<h3 id="724">7.2.4</h3>

<h2 id="long-term-declarative-explicit-memory">LONG-TERM DECLARATIVE (EXPLICIT) MEMORY</h2>

<p>Most of the stuff you’ve got stored in long-term memory is unconscious. In chapter 10, you’ll learn a procedure you can use to take advantage of your unconscious mind to create unique, emotionally powerful song lyrics (including rap lyrics) that will surprise and amaze you (and your listeners).</p>

<p>Two kinds of long-term memory are broadly recognized:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Declarative memory. Sometimes called explicit memory. This is your memory of events, facts, concepts.</li>
  <li>Procedural memory. Sometimes referred to as implicit or non-declarative memory. This is your memory of how to do things-your skills and habits.</li>
</ol>

<p>Starting with declarative memory … there are two kinds: episodic and semantic.</p>

<h1 id="episodic-memory">Episodic Memory</h1>

<p>Episodic memories are memories of one-shot events and experiences that your brain encodes permanently. Thanks to episodic memory, you can recall the story of your life, a series of experiences (“episodes”) stretching back to your early childhood and involving many people and places. In large measure, who you are is what you remember.</p>

<p>In your brain, your hippocampi pass on such memories to your cortex, where they become encoded as long-term memories. (You have two hippocampi, one camped in each hemisphere. If you look at images of them at just the right angle, they look like two hippos sitting around a campfire, roasting squirrels and singing “Kum Ba Yah.”)</p>

<p>If a surgeon were to remove your hippocampi, you would remain forever stuck in the present, unable to remember new experiences, but with memories of your past intact. This was the fate of a patient named H. M. After an operation that successfully relieved his epileptic seizures but involved removal of his hippocampi, H. M. was unable to form new episodic memories. He could only function within the limits of short-term memory. H. M. remained stuck in the moment, in the year 1953, for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>During an emotionally meaningful event, an emotion-processing part of your brain called the amygdala comes into play and burns both the event and the associated emotion vividly into your long-term memory. Events such as the wedding or death of someone close to you; 9/119/11; a car crash in which you broke both your arms but survived. When you recall such an event, you experience the associated emotion as well.</p>

<p>It’s not hard to see why this capacity evolved in humans and other animals. You have a better chance of surviving a future event that threatens your life (or, on the other hand, a future event that improves your odds of passing on your genes) if you recognize from memory a similar event taking shape, and that recollection triggers an emotional reaction. Even in ordinary everyday life, when something in your environment, such as a newspaper headline, reminds you of a traumatic situation you once experienced, you will feel the associated emotion. If what you experienced was extremely traumatic, such as war or violent crime, you may suffer emotionally for many years, every time you recall the experience (post-traumatic stress disorder).</p>

<h2 id="semantic-memory">Semantic Memory</h2>

<p>Semantic memory is your memory of facts, concepts, meaning. Different kinds of information that relate to the same concept or fact are linked in your semantic</p>

<p>memory. For example, your memories of the images of people you know are linked with your memories of their voices and other information about them.</p>

<p>When you see a movie, the visual images become linked in your memory with the musical soundtrack.</p>

<p>You can recall millions of things stored in semantic memory. For instance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You know at least one language, which means you know tens of thousands of words and hundreds of thousands of dictionary definitions (many words have several different meanings).</li>
  <li>You know a lot of stuff you’ve absorbed from reading. It’s the content that exists as semantic memories, not the specific words and sentences.</li>
  <li>You know a lot of songs and song fragments. You may not know all the words and music to thousands of songs, but you could probably recall at least bits and pieces of thousands of songs if prompted with their titles.</li>
</ul>

<p>Semantic memory is the kind of memory that encodes in your brain facts such as the names and birth dates of your band members and their horses. Unlike episodic memory, it often takes effort and repetition to commit information to long-term semantic memory. A good popular song has a lot of repetition to make it easier for listeners to memorize it-whether they want to or not.</p>

<h1 id="725">7.2.5</h1>

<h2 id="long-term-procedural-implicit-memory">LONG-TERM PROCEDURAL (IMPLICIT) MEMORY</h2>

<p>Most of the time, what you commit to procedural memory goes on without your conscious awareness. For instance, you move into a new apartment and gradually “get to know” the place. At first, the stove seems a bit awkward because the controls on the stove at your old place were positioned somewhat differently. And the old stove had smaller burners. Your new kitchen has more lights and you have to learn where the switches are. The toilet runs, so you have to keep flicking the dang handle. Gotta get it fixed.</p>

<p>But after a few weeks, you know where everything is and how every appliance works. You move around your new place without the slightest hesitancy.</p>

<p>Unconsciously and automatically, your brain has stored all the information you need about living comfortably in your new place as procedural memory.</p>

<p>You can also deliberately create procedural memories. This is the kind of memory that enables you to play a musical instrument. Practice, practice, practice. If you finger the same chords and play them rhythmically over and over, after a while it</p>

<p>becomes second nature, like riding a horse or driving a car. Stored permanently in procedural memory.</p>

<p>Table 53 below summarizes the various kinds of memory.</p>

<h2 id="repetition-and-memory-in-music">REPETITION AND MEMORY IN MUSIC</h2>

<p>Recall that the visual metaphor of rhythm is length. As you walk along a street, you can see visual repetition all around you: the spacing between street lamps, the regular dashed white lines in the middle of a paved road, the equally-spaced floors of an apartment or office building. Humans divide space into regular lengths.</p>

<p>In music-making, your brain divides time into regular lengths. Since music takes place in the dimension of time instead of space, memory limitations require that the major musical elements be constantly renewed and reinforced at regular intervals. In other words, repeated.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Harmonically, you have to keep repeating the I chord and the V chord, or your brain forgets where the tonal centre is.</li>
  <li>Melodically, you have to return to scale degree 1 every so often.</li>
  <li>Rhythmically, you have to keep repeating the underlying beat, or your brain forgets there is an underlying beat.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="how-to-get-rid-of-an-earworm">HOW TO GET RID OF AN EARWORM</h1>

<p>James Kellaris, a marketing professor at the University of Cincinnati, is credited with popularizing the term “earworm” ifrom the German ohrwurmi to describe a tune that gets stuck in your head. An earworm is an irritating melodic pattern in your brain that won’t go away. A mental itch. The only way you can scratch it is by playing the earworm in your mind. If you’re lucky, you will eventually find relief within a few hours.</p>

<p>Simple tunes are the best candidates for earworms, such as “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” (aka “Wimoweh” or “Mbube”), “We Will Rock You,” and “It’s A Small World After All.”</p>

<p>Here are several known ways to remove an earworm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Distract yourself by doing something that requires the use of speech and/or music modules, such as singing some other song or reciting the Gettysburg Address.</li>
  <li>Sing the earworm all the way through to the end, then say, “Thang-ya. Thang-ya verra much.” Then say, in an authoritative, yet avuncular voice, “Elvis has left the building.”</li>
  <li>Shoot yourself in the head. Note, however, that Doc YadaYadams, a fully qualified neurosurgeon, advises that this method may not get rid of a particularly nasty, persistent earworm, and could damage some of the delicate structures that comprise other modules in your brain.</li>
</ul>

<p>Marshal McDillon advises that this procedure is illegal. You could get arrested. Ms Puma advises that the Marshal’s logic is faulty. Deputy Fester advises he’ll carry out Marshal McDillon’s orders. Ellie Sue advises she’ll marry Deputy Fester if he writes her a nice song. Jack White of the White Stripes advises he’s going to Wichita. Sadie, President of the Dodge</p>

<h1 id="73">7.3</h1>
<p>Beat vs Pulse</p>

<h3 id="731">7.3.1</h3>
<p>How UNMEASURED MUSIC DiffERS FROM MEASURED MUSIC</p>

<p>Not all music is rhythmic. You sometimes hear music that has no beat. For instance, quite a bit of background television and movie music consists of nothing more than irregular successions of chords or melodic flourishes. You hear similar sounds in subgenres of New Age and environmental music. And medieval plainchant. And some Chinese and Japanese music.</p>

<p>Free-flowing unaccompanied music with no regular beat is called unmeasured music or measureless music.</p>

<p>When other voices or instruments begin to accompany free-flowing chords or melodies, the brain senses a desire to have the sounds synchronized. Otherwise, chaos may reign.</p>

<p>Sometimes chaos does reign. For instance, when-deliberately or accidentallyseveral instruments play simultaneously without any intention of synching up. Or when the players of a symphony orchestra tune their instruments to the oboe player’s A-440 just before a performance.</p>

<p>Music that has a steady beat throughout, even during brief silent passages (fermatas or pauses), is called measured music. The uniquely human ability to entrain to a steady beat gives rise to the organizing principle that makes possible everything rhythmic in music, just as human attunement to simple ratios of frequencies makes scales and chords possible.</p>

<p>Measured music is the default, the musical universal; unmeasured music is the exception.</p>

<p>Interestingly, there seems to be no half-way point between measured and unmeasured music. Music either has a steady beat you can entrain to, or it has no discernable beat. Hardly any music is partly measured and partly unmeasured. Hundreds of thousands or perhaps millions of years ago, hominids undoubtedly used</p>

<p>rocks as the first musical instruments (other than singing, hand clapping, footstomping). Imagine: rocks as percussion instruments. Beat-keeping devices.</p>

<p>Today, practically all the music most people hear is measured music, music with a steady underlying beat. That’s “home,” rhythmically speaking. It’s the ceaseless, steady, unchanging beat that makes rhythmic adventure possible, just as tonality makes melodic and harmonic adventure possible.</p>

<h1 id="732">7.3.2</h1>

<h2 id="how-your-brain-predicts-the-beat-in-measured-music">How Your Brain “Predicts” the Beat in Measured Music</h2>

<h2 id="brains-are-prediction-machines">Brains are prediction machines.</h2>
<p>-GEOFFREY MILLER</p>

<p>Rhythmic motion originates in the brain, not in dancing leg muscles. Just as singing a song originates in the brain, not in the movement of vocal folds in the larynx. In measured music, stimulus does not lead to response; stimulus coincides with response. Perception and action couple together.</p>

<p>The human brain has evolved the capacity to predict when the next beat will occur. If this were not the case, you would not have the ability to tap your foot in time to, say, the steady click of a metronome. Your foot-tapping would fall behind or speed ahead erratically. You have the capacity to synchronize your behaviour to a steady beat, and so do your fellow humans-your audience.</p>

<p>Since stimulus and response coincide in a regular beat, the beat functions, in effect, as the stimulus for synchronizing behaviour. Groups of humans have the ability, then, to lock into an isometric train of beats, coordinating behaviour en masse.</p>

<p>It has been hypothesized that hearing a steady beat induces neural “clocks” in your brain that enable you to synchronize your physical movements to the sequence of beats. So you can sing, dance, or play a musical instrument in sync with an external regular beat. You have the natural ability to move in response to music (e.g., dance), and also to move whatever body parts you need to move to create music (sing or play an instrument).</p>

<p>Because you have a sophisticated beat-prediction ability, a simple steady beat can bore you pretty quickly. So great songwriters and performers tend to deliberately foil your beat prediction mechanism, as you’ll see later in discussions of irregular meter, syncopation, and improvisation.</p>

<h1 id="733">7.3.3</h1>
<p>How Beat Differs from Pulse</p>

<p>This chapter focuses on measured music, music with a beat. If you want to understand how to manipulate beat in your songwriting and performing to create emotionally powerful music, you need a good grasp of the nature of these fundamental elements and how they work:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Beat</li>
  <li>Pulse</li>
  <li>Meter</li>
  <li>Tempo</li>
  <li>Rhythm</li>
</ul>

<p>They’re all different, but interrelated.</p>

<p>First: distinguishing beat from pulse. For purposes of this discussion, beat refers to the basic, undifferentiated metronomic temporal setting of a piece of music.</p>

<p>Here are some ways to conceptualize “beat”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you’ve done some recording, you’re probably familiar with click tracks. Think of beat as the click track of a song, the simple, steady ticking of the metronome. Suppose you play a recording of a song through a sound system. As the recording plays, suppose you set a digital metronome so that it ticks in sync with the recorded song. That metronome’s ticking is the beat.</li>
  <li>Beat has no emphasis, no accent. It’s just tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick. It’s not TICK tick TICK tick TICK tick TICK tick TICK tick.</li>
  <li>Beat continues on in your brain even when the music temporarily ceases.</li>
  <li>Beat is the rhythmic unit that gets you tapping your foot or clapping your hands or nodding your head or pumping your fist.</li>
  <li>As you’ll see later, beat is not necessarily the smallest unit of time in a piece of music. But it’s the basic unit.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="pulse">Pulse</h1>

<p>Some authorities make no distinction between beat and pulse. For purposes of this discussion, think of pulse as different from beat, but related. Here’s how.</p>

<p>When you switch on an ordinary metronome, at first you hear this: tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick …</p>

<p>But within a moment or two, your brain perceives groups of two ticks, like this: TICK tick TICK tick TICK tick TICK tick …</p>

<p>Or, depending on your mood, groups of three ticks, like this: TICK tick tick TICK tick tick TICK tick tick …</p>

<p>Or groups of four ticks, like this: TICK tick TICK tick TICK tick TICK tick…</p>

<p>That’s your brain automatically chunking beats into pulses. Even though you know that the ticks of the metronome do not vary in loudness, your brain will have none of it. Instead, your brain assigns every second or third beat a seemingly louder “tick,” a stress or accent, thus chunking (grouping) a sequence of undifferentiated ticks into larger, more comprehensible units.</p>

<p>Pulse is the first of several levels of beat chunking. The same thing happens in speech. Every time you open your mouth and utter a phrase or sentence, you automatically stress some syllables more than others. You emphasize every second or third syllable. When you say “metal,” you don’t say “met-al” in a monotone. Instead, you say: “Met” is not louder than “al”; rather, “met” is higher in pitch. It doesn’t matter whether you speak English or Hindi or Inuktitut. Your brain’s language modules have evolved to distinguish words and phrases from each other in part through differential pitch-accenting of syllables.</p>

<p>With words, it’s pitch that varies from syllable to syllable. With pulse, it’s loudness (and, with one type of pulse, duration also) that varies from beat to beat.</p>

<p>Pulse always has at least one accented beat and one unaccented beat. There are three (and only three) varieties of pulse:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Duple pulse: two beats of equal duration, the first of which is accented;</li>
  <li>Triple pulse: three beats of equal duration, the first of which is accented;</li>
  <li>Skipple pulse: two beats of unequal duration, the first of which is accented.</li>
</ul>

<p>Musicians who play rhythm parts tend to play pulses, not beats. For instance, in rock, when you hear the drummer’s familiar “kick-snare-kick-snare,” you attend more to pairs of beats (pulses), not individual beats.</p>

<p>When you listen to music (especially live music), sometimes you tap or clap or nod or pump on every unaccented beat of a pulse (the off beat or back beat). Sometimes you tap on every accented beat of a pulse. But not often on both accented and unaccented beats (a good workout!).</p>

<p>If you’re at a bluegrass festival and you tap your foot on the unaccented beat during a fast rendition of “Fox On The Run,” unkind strangers might point at you and laugh.</p>

<p>If you’re at a gospel revival and you clap on the accented beat during “Oh Happy Day,” unkind strangers might point at you and laugh.</p>

<p>Before elaborating on each pulse type, a word on habituation.</p>

<h1 id="734">7.3.4</h1>

<h2 id="how-habituation-works">How Habituation Works</h2>

<p>Your brain attunes and responds to change. If a stimulus in the environment does not change, your brain starts to ignore it. This phenomenon is called habituation. It applies to all sorts of stimuli. For example, you wake up and smell the coffee. But within a little while, you don’t smell the coffee any more, even though the aroma is still in the air, because you’ve become habituated. Nothing has changed, so your brain ignores it.</p>

<p>If you hear a sound repeated over and over, habituation kicks in. Your neurons get fatigued. Response diminishes. After a while, your brain ignores the repeated sound unless something unexpected happens. This applies to every element of songwriting, and to whole songs. A successful song introduces novelty at some level at frequent intervals as it unfolds in time. But not too much novelty, or listeners get confused and lose interest. Novelty (variety) is vital, but repetition (unity) is equally vital.</p>

<p>To avoid rhythmic habituation, you use various rhythmic phrases that contrast with the steady beat. That way, you get unity and variety happening simultaneously. The first level of beat-contrast is pulse.</p>

<h1 id="74">7.4</h1>
<p>Types of Pulse</p>

<h3 id="741">7.4.1</h3>

<h2 id="duplequadruple-pulse">DuPle/QuadrUple Pulse</h2>

<p>Of the three varieties of pulse, duple pulse is by far the most common-one accented beat, followed by one unaccented beat: ONE two.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left">Accents</th>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Duple pulse almost invariably chunks (groups) into pairs of duples: four beats, with the first and third having an accent: ONE two THREE four ONE two THREE four. Beat one has a heavier accent than beat three. Like this:</p>

<table>
  <thead>

      <td style="text-align: left">4</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This is the default pulse-quadruple pulse-the pulse your brain finds easiest and most natural, the pulse of the great majority of popular songs. Classical music, too.</p>

<h3 id="742">7.4.2</h3>

<h2 id="triple-pulse">Triple Pulse</h2>

<p>Triple pulse is not as common-one accented beat, followed by two unaccented beats: ONE two three. Like this:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left">Accents</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">∙∙</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">∙∙</th>

<p>While not found in many popular songs, triple pulse plays an important role in several kinds of meter, the level of chunking immediately above pulse. You’ll see how shortly.</p>

<h1 id="743">7.4.3</h1>
<p>SKIPPLE PULSE</p>

<p>The first two pulse types-duple and triple-you know well. But skipple? Skipple is also known variously as “swing” or “shuffle” or “triplet groove.” But such descriptors don’t cut it.</p>

<p>In North America and Europe, “swing” narrowly connotes swing music of the 1930s and 1940s-“Big Band” music. But the fact is, skipple pulse can be found in every major genre of popular music, past and present: blues, jazz, hip-hop, rock, folk, country, you name it. It’s also common in traditional native American music.</p>

<p>Skipple pulse is found in all sorts of non-Western music as well, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bhangra, a style of centuries-old Punjabi folk music that has lately become a global phenomenon</li>
  <li>Much indigenous African music (e. g. Burundi drumming)</li>
  <li>Music of the Tuvan horse culture (see, for example, the documentary Genghis Blues).</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, skipple pulse is second only to duple/quadruple in pervasiveness worldwide-ahead of triple pulse.</p>

<p>If you’ve had formal music theory, it’s unlikely your instructors gave skipple pulse much of a mention, except perhaps in a discussion of swing or shuffle.</p>

<p>Skipple pulse plays a central role in popular music. A good grasp of skipple pulse will help you a lot in your songwriting efforts. Skipple has a distinctive uneven gait. Songs with skipple pulse tend to grab the ear.</p>

<p>In all three pulse types, the first beat gets the accent. What distinguishes the accented beat in skipple pulse is that it persists for twice the duration of the unaccented beat. Skipple has the effect of propelling you forward. It gets you moving and dancing.</p>

<p>To get a sense of skipple, try this when no one’s around-you don’t want them to think you’ve lost your mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Remember when you were five years old and you would skip along the sidewalk? Step with left foot, hop with left foot, step with right foot, hop with right foot. STEP-hop, STEP-hop, STEP-hop, STEP-hop … Go ahead, try it. Indoors with the curtains drawn. Skip around the room. Watch out for the cat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As you skip around like a fool (but who cares, nobody’s watching), you’ll notice that the “STEP” takes twice as long as the “hop.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While you’re at it, you can sing some songs in skipple pulse, songs that you learned way before you started school. Songs such as “Ring Around The Rosy” and “Pop Goes The Weasel” and “The Farmer In The Dell.” In all of these songs, you can easily feel the skipple pulse.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Of the three pulses, skipple most closely resembles your heartbeat: thuummp-a thuummp-a thuummp-a thuummp-a</p>

<h1 id="mashing-duple-and-triple-yields-skipple">Mashing Duple and Triple Yields Skipple</h1>

<p>Skipple embodies both duple and triple pulse, without being either. When you mash duple and triple, you get skipple.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Here’s a duple pulse, which has two beats of equal duration, the first of which is accented:</li>
</ul>

<p>When skipple pulses are present in a song, they are almost always embedded in duple or triple pulses, as indicated in the above diagrams (there are some unusual exceptions). So whenever you hear the characteristic thuuummmp-a thuuummmp-a of skipple pulse in a song, you’re actually hearing two types of pulses simultaneously:</p>

<ul>
  <li>On the “micro” level-the level of the individual beat-the pulse is skipple.</li>
  <li>On the “macro” level-the level of grouped beats-the pulse is duple, quadruple, or triple.</li>
</ul>

<p>With embedded skipple pulses, the effect sounds far different from ordinary duple or triple pulse.</p>

<h2 id="beethoven-barrelhouseboogie-composer">BEETHOVEN: BARRELHOUSE/BOOGIE COMPOSER</h2>

<p>Beethoven’s last piano sonata, Opus 111 (1821-22), has a fantastic barrelhouse/boogie-woogie section, probably the first ever committed to paper. It’s an example of skipple-pulse piano style at its finest. To hear it, go to this link: <a href="http://www.ivbeethoven.com/Quuques/Music_MidiSonatasPiano.html">www.IVBeethoven.com/Quuques/Music_MidiSonatasPiano.html</a> Scroll to the bottom of the page, where you’ll find two midi files of the entire 21- to 24-minute sonata idepending on how fast it’s played), each sequenced by a different musician. Click on either one to hear the sonata. When it starts playing, grab the slider and whip it over to about 60%60% of the way through the piece. The</p>

<h1 id="744">7.4.4</h1>

<h2 id="are-there-any-other-pulses">Are There Any Other Pulses?</h2>

<p>No. Other pulse-wannabes have these problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Accent on the wrong beat. For instance, suppose you turn skipple around, like this:</li>
</ul>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left">Accents</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">∙∙</th>

      <td style="text-align: left">1</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If you clap your hands to this pulse, you soon notice that the second, longer beat, sounds like a powerful echo of the first, short beat. After a short while, this pulse becomes indistinguishable from skipple.</p>

<p>What’s goin’ on? The double-length duration of the second beat carries a heavier accent by virtue of its duration than the first beat carries by virtue of its position. So your brain tends to “flip it over” into standard skipple. The first note then acquires a double accent (loudness and duration). So skipple’s the natural pulse; its inverse is not.</p>

<ul>
  <li>More than three beats. Suppose you try a pulse like this:</li>
</ul>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left">Accents</th>

<p>Here, the first beat is triple the duration of the second beat, not double. This pattern is sometimes called shuffle, although there’s no general agreement. Some folks refer to skipple as shuffle.</p>

<p>The number of beats inherent in the above pulse-wannabe is four, which is divisible by two. Your brain senses it’s binary nature and promptly breaks it down into two duple pulses. (More on the importance of binary structure in songwriting in Chapter 8.)</p>

<p>The thing to remember about pulses is that they are the smallest beat chunks that your brain recognizes in any sequence of beats. By definition, a pulse is a group of beats in which one beat is accented. So, clearly, a pulse must be comprised of at least two beats. But a pulse cannot have more than three beats because your brain chunks four or more beats into pulses of two or three. So there can only be three pulse types: duple, triple, and skipple.</p>

<h2 id="meter-and-time-signature">Meter and Time Signature</h2>

<h3 id="751">7.5.1</h3>

<h2 id="what-meter-is-and-how-it-works">What Meter Is and How it Works</h2>

<p>As discussed above, when your brain hears a train of beats, it automatically groups the beats into pulses. Beats have no accents and are not inherently “musical.” (In a sense, “beat” in rhythm is analogous to the chromatic scale in melody and harmony.) Your brain automatically groups beats into pulses. Pulses have accents. Performers play music in pulses, not beats.</p>

<h2 id="pulse-chunking">Pulse Chunking</h2>

<p>Your brain groups pulses into larger chunks called bars or measures. A bar (or, in America, a measure) may be comprised of one, two, or three pulses. Most commonly, it’s two pulses.</p>

<p>For example, instead of hearing a sequence of duple pulses (ONE-two ONE-two, etc.), you perceive pairs of duple pulses as larger chunks (ONE-two-THREE-four).</p>

<p>European classical composers came up with a method of notating chunks of pulses, which became known as “meter.” But European composers did not invent meter. Darwinian natural selection invented meter. The human brain spontaneously chunks beats into pulses and pulses into bars (measures). A musician playing by ear and improvising a piece of music often has no idea that a formally-trained composer or songwriter would code the pulse groupings he or she is playing into measures of, say, four beats (two duple pulses). North American aboriginal people, for example, were drumming and dancing and singing in measures of two duple pulses (and other pulse types) for thousands of years before the European invasion.</p>

<h1 id="752">7.5.2</h1>
<p>How Beat, Pulse, and Meter Relate to Each OTHER</p>

<p>Some musicians equate pulse with meter, just as some equate beat with pulse. Not a good idea in either case. Occasionally, pulse and meter do coincide, in which case you can say that the pulse is the meter. But most of the time, meter consists of a group of pulses.</p>

<p>In speech, something similar occurs. Two words, such as “metal” and “worker,” group like two duple pulses. Individually, each word has the same accent pattern:</p>

<p>In music, a grouping of pulses like this is called a bar or measure:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left">Accents</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">∙∙</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">∙∙</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">∙∙</th>

    </tr>

      <td style="text-align: left">3</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">4</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Pulse and meter coincide when three beats chunk, as in “Blue Danube”-type waltz meter. This is both a single pulse and a single bar or measure:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left">Accents</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">∙∙</th>

      <td style="text-align: center">2</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">3</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

<h2 id="how-time-signature-works-merely-a-silent-notational-convenience">How Time Signature Works: Merely a Silent Notational Convenience</h2>

<p>At the beginning of a piece of notated music, you see what looks like a fraction, such as:</p>

<p>3443​</p>

<p>It’s not a fraction. It’s the time signature of the piece, and it gives you a clue about the beat, pulse, and meter. Only a clue, though. It does not tell you everything you need to know.</p>

<p>Sometimes the time signature is erroneously called the “meter signature.” That leads to confusion about the difference between meter and time signature.</p>

<p>So, what is the difference between meter and time signature?</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can hear meter because it consists of pulses. Musicians play pulses.</li>
  <li>You cannot hear time signature. Time signature exists only on paper (or computer screen) as a convenient way of notating information about beat, pulse, and meter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Suppose, for example, you see the following time signature at the beginning of a lead sheet:</p>

<p>4444​</p>

<p>What does it mean? First, as mentioned, it’s not a fraction: it does not mean “four divided by four.”</p>

<ul>
  <li>In 4/44/4 meter (also called “ 4/44/4 time”), the time signature tells you that the notated music divides time into bars (or measures) of four beats (the top number), and that a certain type of note, called a quarter-note (bottom number) is the time-value of one beat. The bottom number gives you a clue about how fast to play the music. Generally, the larger the bottom number, the shorter the time value of each note; hence, the faster the composer wants you to play the music.</li>
  <li>In 3/43/4 time, the top number tells you that each bar has three beats. The bottom number provides the same information as in 4/44/4 meter-it indicates the time-value of each beat.</li>
</ul>

<p>The thing to keep in mind about time signatures is that, because a time signature only exists on paper, you can notate a piece of music on paper in any time signature that suits your fancy (if you happen to know how to notate music). If you do it correctly, and if the musicians play it correctly, it will sound “correct” to the listener, regardless of which the time signature you use.</p>

<p>For instance, “The Star Spangled Banner” is usually notated in 3/4 time. However, you could notate it in 3/23/2 time or 3/83/8 time. If you correctly follow the</p>

<p>rules of notation, and if the players interpret it correctly (including the notation of tempo, which would vary with each time signature in order to ensure the music would be played at the same tempo, regardless of time signature), the song will sound exactly the same to listeners, whether the music is notated in 3/4,3/23/4,3/2, or 3/83/8 time.</p>

<p>If you really knew what you were doing, you could even notate “The Star Spangled Banner” in 5/4 time and make it sound to listeners as though it were in 3/4 time-provided the musicians playing the piece knew what they were doing (all the while cursing you for your notational eccentricity).</p>

<p>As you’ll see shortly, if you want to, you can divide a metronome’s ticks into bars of, say, five or seven beats. But you have to make a conscious effort to make such groupings sound coherent. And even when you do, your brain still breaks these large groupings into pulses of two or three beats.</p>

<h1 id="76">7.6</h1>
<p>Varieties of Meter</p>

<p>There are four varieties of meter, each representing different combinations of pulse type and number of pulses to the bar:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Simple meter</li>
  <li>Compound meter</li>
  <li>Combined meter</li>
  <li>Irregular meter</li>

<p>Combined duple meter consists of two “macro” beats, which chunk into one duple pulse. Each macro beat is itself comprised of one skipple pulse. So you have two skipple pulses embedded within a single duple pulse. Like this:</p>

<h2 id="important-note-on-time-signature-and-combined-meter">Important Note on Time Signature and Combined Meter</h2>

<p>With simple and compound meter, the time signature tells you something about the beat, pulse, and meter. Not so with combined meter.</p>

<p>Time signatures only provide information about simple meter and compound meter. They do not tell you anything about combined meter, which contains embedded skipple pulses.</p>

<p>A song in combined meter may be notated in any simple or compound time signature: 3/4,4/4,6/4,6/8,9/8,12/83/4,4/4,6/4,6/8,9/8,12/8, you name it.</p>

<p>Immediately, then, you wonder:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When you see a lead sheet in, say, 4/44/4 time (according to the time signature), how do you know whether it’s simple meter (two duple pulses) or combined meter (two duple pulses comprised of four embedded skipple pulses)? It could be either.</li>
  <li>If it’s in 6/86/8 time, how do you know if it’s compound meter (two triple pulses) or combined meter (two skipple pulses)? It could be either.</li>
  <li>If it’s in 3/43/4 time, how do you know if it’s simple meter (one triple pulse) or combined meter (three skipple pulses)? It could be either.</li>
</ul>

<p>The short answer is, you can’t tell just by looking at the time signature. Occasionally, the songwriter lets you know at the top of a lead sheet with this notation:</p>

<p>When you see this, the songwriter or arranger clearly wants you to play skipple pulses. So if the time signature is 4/44/4, you would play four skipple pulses to the bar instead of two duple pulses (four beats) to the bar.</p>

<p>Table 56 summarizes how combined meter differs from both simple meter and compound meter. Find (or download) and listen to some of the examples listed in the table (nearly all are on the Gold Standard Song List). The examples will provide you with a good feel for combined meter and how it differs from simple meter and compound meter.</p>

Each macro beat is comprised of one skipple pulse. So the 2 skipple pulses are “embedded” within the macro duple pulse.  <br />- In combined quadruple meter, there are four macro beats to the bar. Each macro beat is comprised of one skipple pulse. So the 4 skipple pulses are embedded within the 2 macro duple pulses.</td>

<h1 id="how-double-skipple-pulse-works-in-hip-hop">How Double Skipple Pulse Works in Hip-hop</h1>

<p>Much hip-hop music seems to be in simple duple/quadruple meter.

<p>Lyrically, you can cram as many as 24 syllables into a single bar. Some hip-hop lyricists do exactly that (see Chapter 10).</p>

<p>You will find this type of combined meter, played at a fast clip, everywhere in bhangra.</p>

<h1 id="764">7.6.4</h1>
<p>IRREGULAR METER</p>

<p>Your brain recognizes only three types of pulse: duple, triple, and skipple. Grouping “like” pulses together-duple with duple, triple with triple, skipple with skippleresults in various types of simple, compound, and combined meter, as discussed above.</p>

<p>But if you combine a mixture of pulses to create measures of five, seven, ten, eleven, or thirteen beats, your brain has to work pretty hard at tracking the oddly grouped beat sequences, called irregular meter.</p>

<p>To simplify the task, your brain chunks the beats into mixed patterns of two-beat or three-beat pulses. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Measure of 5 beats =2+3=2+3 or 3+23+2</li>
  <li>Measure of 7 beats =4+3=4+3 or 2+2+32+2+3 or 3+43+4 or 3+2+23+2+2, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>With the exception of jazz, not much Western popular and classical music is written in irregular meter. In the musical traditions of some countries, such as Turkey, India, and Greece, irregular meter is more common, although the measures then tend to group into twos, fours, and multiples of four.</p>

<p>Table 57 summarizes the main characteristics of irregular meter.</p>

<p>As with simple or compound meter, you can also turn each beat into a skipple pulse, creating combined irregular meter. “Take Five” and “Money” are well-known examples.</p>

<h1 id="the-brewski-method-of-coping-with-unusual-meter">THE “BREWSKI” METHOD OF COPING WITH UNUSUAL METER</h1>

<p>If you have trouble counting in an uncommon meter such as 7/8, 9/8, or 5/4 meter, try the “brewski” method. Use a phrase with strong accents that match the chunked metrical divisions. For instance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To count in 7/8 time, say, “NOW-I-can-HAVE-a-BREW-ski,” which chunks 7/8 meter into 3-2-2. If the chunking is 2-2-3, you have to start the phrase at a different place. For example, Pink Floyd’s “Money” is chunked 2-2-3, so you have to say, “HAVE-a-BREW-ski-NOW-i-can.”</li>
  <li>In 9/8 time, say, “NOW-i-can-HAVE-me-a-NOTH-er-one.”</li>
  <li>In 5/4 time, it’s just “NOW-i-can-HAVE-a.” Try this one with “Take Five.”</li>
</ul>

<p>In 1959, jazz alto sax genius Paul Desmond demonstrated how to swing in irregular meter. As a member of the Dave Brubeck Quartet, Desmond wrote and recorded “Take Five,” one of the great classics of jazz. “Take Five” combines skipple pulse on every beat with irregular measures of five beats, chunked into one triple and one duple pulse. The skipple pulses are embedded like this (one measure):</p>

<h2 id="pink-floyds-money-how-and-why-it-works-brilliantly">Pink Floyd’s “Money”: How and Why It Works Brilliantly</h2>

<p>Pink Floyd’s “Money” also combines skipple pulse with irregular meter, but “Money” has seven-beat measures instead of five-beat measures. Written by Roger Waters for the group’s 1973 album Dark Side of the Moon, “Money” stands as one of the greatest, most original classics in rock history.</p>

<p>If you’ve never studied how this masterpiece works, now’s the time. Saddle up. You will learn a lot about what goes into the creation of an immortal song, a song that soars miles above the vast ocean of pop mediocrity.</p>

<p>If you don’t have the words and lyrics for “Money,” go fetch ‘em so that you can follow the discussion below. You’ll need the original recording from Dark Side of the</p>

<p>Moon. If you don’t already have it, you can download it for a buck at iTunes or PureTracks or Yahoo! or any other legal vendor.</p>

<p>Also, get the lyrics: go to www. GoldStandardSonet.ist.com and click on “How to Get Lyrics” (under “Basics”).</p>

<p>Listen to the song once or twice, and follow the lyrics to refresh your memory. Now you’re ready.</p>

<p>Here are some of the reasons “Money” has been wildly successful for decades, both commercially and artistically.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Seven-beat meter that works. Practically unheard-of in successful rock music. The irregular meter is the first thing that catches your brain’s attention, the first thing that makes “Money” stand out against the overwhelming majority of popular songs, which are in regular meter. Some songwriters take a stab at irregular meter, but hardly any succeed in making it work. Here’s why seven-beat meter succeeds in “Money”:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Clear chunking. The seven-beat measures are clearly chunked into two duple pulses followed by one triple pulse. No ambiguity. If you want to make irregular meter work (five- or seven-beat), you have to be absolutely clear about the chunking right from the beginning.</li>
  <li>Embedded skipple pulses on every beat. From the beginning of “Money” (after the opening cash register bit) the bass repeats a sequence of eight notes to the bar, one on each beat except for the third beat, which gets two notes, played as a skipple pulse. NOTE:</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>The bass is the first instrument you hear. It begins on the second note of the measure, not the first.</li>
  <li>The black dots in the diagrams below represent pulses and accents only, not pitch:</li>
</ol>

<p>That skipple pulse on the third beat, repeated in every bar, is crucial, because it signals that this song is in combined irregular meter, not just ordinary irregular meter. This metrical characteristic-combined meter, with skipple pulses on every beat-is another element that sets “Money” apart from the great majority of popular songs, which are in simple meter (no skipple pulses).</p>

<p>As the other instruments join the bass, they reinforce the fact that each beat is actually a skipple pulse. None of the instruments plays skipple pulses on every beat-only on one or two beats per seven-beat measure. That’s all it takes. As well, the vocal, when it comes in, contributes skipple pulses once or twice per measure.</p>

<p>This is one of the most important characteristics of skipple pulses: they are so distinctive and powerful that it’s not necessary (and often not desirable) to play skipple pulses on every beat to establish the propulsive skipple feel. “Money”commendably walks the line. The voice, bass, guitar, keyboards, sax, drums-each contributes skipple pulses once or twice per measure. That’s enough to keep the skipple feel of the meter alive throughout the song. If one or two (or more) of the players had played skipple pulses on every beat throughout the song, it would have overwhelmed the rhythm and ruined the arrangement.</p>

<p>Here’s a metrical picture of one of the verses. Note that the first word, “Money,” begins on the second beat of the measure, not the first beat. This is one way of thwarting rhythmic prediction, making the word “money” stand out:</p>

<p>Whenever two syllables appear on one beat, they’re sung as a skipple pulse: in the above example, keep your and off of. This happens in all of the verses, reinforcing the skipple feel. 2. Successful changes of meter. Few popular songs change meter abruptly midsong. This one does it with ease. It’s another characteristic of “Money” that sets this song apart from the mass of songs. At about the three-minute mark, partway through the instrumental bridge, the song smoothly transitions from seven beats to four beats per bar: combined quadruple meter. The skipple pulses remain on every macro beat. The meter switches back to seven beats at the end of the instrumental section, then switches again to four beats at the end of the last verse.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Successful changes of tempo. Few popular songs change tempo abruptly mid-song. “Money” does. The song begins at about 118 beats per minute (BPM) and gradually drifts up to about 126 BPM by the two minute mark, where it remains for the next 60 seconds or so. Then, at the same time as the song changes meter from seven to four beats per bar, the tempo also suddenly speeds up to about 136 to 138 BPM. The combination of change of meter and simultaneous abrupt increase in tempo is startling, to say the least. At the end of the long instrumental bridge, the meter returns to seven beats and the tempo slows down somewhat to about 126 .</li>
  <li>Minor mode. Few songwriters have the nerve to write in the minor mode. Too bad. As noted in Chapter 5, the minor mode is emotionally powerful. Songs in minor keys such as “Money” (the recording is in the key of B minor), grab the ear because they stand out against the great majority of popular songs, which are in the major mode.</li>
  <li>Appropriately simple chord progression. With so much unusual stuff going on with the meter and tempo, the songwriter wisely decided to keep the harmony simple and straightforward. The song has only three simple chords-the three principal chords of the minor key.</li>
  <li>Superior melody. See Chapter 9.</li>
  <li>Sharp, focussed, satirical lyrics. See Chapter 10.</li>
</ol>

<p>In short, Roger Waters got practically everything right with “Money,” everything needed to set this song apart from what you usually hear on rock radio. No wonder Dark Side of the Moon has sold tens of millions of copies since 1973, and continues to sell in the hundreds of thousands every year.</p>

<h2 id="relative-popularity-of-the-four-types-of-meter">Relative Popularity of the Four Types of METER</h2>

<p>Songs in simple quadruple meter (“ 4/44/4 time”) are far and away more numerous than songs in all other varieties of meter put together. That doesn’t mean simple quadruple is better than the others. It’s simply the easiest to play and most accessible for listeners. It’s the default meter.</p>

<p>Songs in combined meter are more prevalent in popular music than songs in compound meter. Despite this, music schools and instructors teach students about</p>

<p>simple meter and compound meter, but rarely recognize combined meter in its own right.</p>

<p>If you were to randomly sample a large number of recordings of great songs in a variety of genres-hip-hop, pop, rock, folk, jazz, blues, country-from, say, 1900 to 1999, you would probably get a relative distribution of the popularity of meter types that would look something like Figure 130.</p>

<p>A lot of songwriters gravitate to simple quadruple out of ignorance about the other metrical possibilities-especially combined meter.</p>

<p>So, if you want your songs to stand out … make a deliberate effort to write more songs in meters other than simple quadruple.</p>

<p>The most naturally driving, forceful meter is not simple quadruple. It’s combined quadruple.</p>

<h2 id="combined-quadruple-not-the-most-common-but-the-coolest-meter">Combined Quadruple: Not the Most Common, but the Coolest Meter</h2>

<p>As previously mentioned, combined quadruple is the signature meter of African American genres: jazz, blues, R &amp; B, soul, hip-hop. It’s not nearly as pervasive in rock, country, and folk. It’s rare in dance/electronica.</p>

<p>The defining characteristic of combined meter is the embedded skipple pulse on every macro beat, skipple being the only pulse-type with a double accent:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Metrical position accent. The first beat of any pulse type, including skipple, is the accented beat.</li>
  <li>Duration accent. Sounds of long duration are more emphatic than sounds of short duration. In skipple pulse, the first beat is twice the duration of the second. Technically, this is called agogic accent.</li>
</ol>

<p>Powerfully-accented skipple pulses have a lot of inherent drive or propulsion, even at slow tempos.</p>

<p>In the 1960s and 70s, many a rock songwriter with a strong affinity for the blues wrote great songs in combined quadruple. Brian Wilson, for instance: “California Girls,” “Help Me, Rhonda,” “Good Vibrations,” “Wouldn’t It Be Nice” and others. Eric Clapton’s acoustic version of “Layla” is in combined quadruple meter, unlike his original electric version (simple quadruple).</p>

<p>Lennon and McCartney used combined quadruple meter much more often in the last four years of their songwriting partnership than in the first four years.</p>

<p>Bob Dylan also wrote many classics in combined quadruple. Granted, it’s his lyrics that have defined him as one of the greatest songwriters of all time. But it didn’t hurt that he also chose the coolest meter-combined quadruple-as the metrical setting for some of those lyrics.</p>

<p>Here are a few of Dylan’s combined quadruple meter songs (all written in the 1960s, when the songwriter was in his early and mid twenties): “It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry” “Ballad Of A Thin Man” “Highway 61 Revisited” “Rainy Day Women ≠12=12 &amp; ≠35=35 (Everybody Must Get Stoned)” “Leopardskin Pillbox Hat” “Just Like A Woman” “Sad-Eyed Lady Of The Lowlands” “This Wheel’s On Fire” “Dear Landlord”</p>

<p>To get a feel for how Dylan uses combined quadruple meter, skipple on over to www. BobDylan.com. There you can listen to audio samples of hundreds of his recordings.</p>

<p>The original, first recordings of the songs listed above are in combined quadruple meter, so listen to them first. Then listen to later recordings of the same tunes, usually linked just below the originals. Many are not in combined quadruple.</p>

<p>For instance, the original recording of “It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry,” from the album Highway 61 Revisited, is in combined quadruple. This is the soulful, blues-infused rendition. Compare it with Dylan’s version of the same song from The Bootleg Series, Volumes 1-3, recorded 26 years later. It’s much faster, and Dylan has changed the meter to simple quadruple, a straight-ahead rock interpretation.</p>

<p>Tempo</p>

<h3 id="771">7.7.1</h3>

<h2 id="what-tempo-is-and-how-it-works">What Tempo Is and How it Works</h2>

<p>Tempo refers to the speed at which you play a piece of music. A notation of tempo can refer to the speed in beats per minute (simple or compound meter) or the speed in pulses per minute (embedded skipple pulses in combined meter).</p>

<p>At the beginning of a notated song in 4/44/4 time, you might see this:</p>

<p>θ˙˙=120θ˙˙=120</p>

<p>which simply means, “Play this song at 120 BPM.” Which could mean either 120 beats per minute or 120 skipple pulses per minute.</p>

<p>If the same piece of music were notated in 6/86/8 time, you might see this:</p>

<p>θ˙˙=120θ˙˙=120</p>

<p>which means, “Play this song at 120 BPM.” Exactly the same. But the feel of the meter would be different from simple quadruple, because 6/86/8 means triple pulses instead of duple pulses.</p>

<h1 id="772">7.7.2</h1>

<h2 id="how-tempo-affects-meter">How TEMPO AFFECTS METER</h2>

<p>Recordings of popular songs tend to have a pretty narrow tempo range, usually about 110 to 140 BPM. This range amounts to the “default tempo” of popular music.</p>

<p>In the recording process, producers sometimes obsess about maintaining a rocksteady tempo throughout the recording of a song. More for technical than artistic reasons. That is, if the tempo varies on the bed tracks, then players and singers doing overdubs could have problems playing or singing in sync. The decades-old studio method of maintaining an unchanging tempo is to first record a click track, a digitalmetronome track.</p>

<p>Usually, it’s not necessary. Consider “Money,” for instance. In the first two minutes, it speeds up by roughly 8 BPM, then leaps another 12 BPM. Then it slows down noticeably again during the last couple of minutes. All those tempo changes didn’t affect the song’s success. The leap of 12 BPM in the middle clearly made the song more appealing.</p>

<p>Tempo changes within a piece of music are usually slow-a gradual increase in tempo (accelerando), or a gradual decrease (ritardando). However, if there’s a large tempo change, it almost invariably occurs in a simple ratio: the beat doubles or it halves. Or a halved tempo triples.</p>

<p>If the music does not expressly call for accelerando, as in Joe Cocker’s interpretation of “With A Little Help From My Friends,” or ritardando, as in Gordon Lightfoot’s “Canadian Railroad Trilogy” (which also has accelerando), then playing at a steady tempo is, supposedly, a mark of skilled musicianship.</p>

<p>Unintentionally speeding up is called rushing. Unintentionally slowing down is dragging.</p>

<p>What happens to the meter when you decide to perform a song from beginning to end at a completely different tempo than, say, the original recording?</p>

<p>Significantly changing the tempo can actually change the meter. Changing the meter greatly affects how the whole song sounds, even when it’s the same vocalist, same players, same instruments, same lyrics.</p>

<p>If you do this intentionally, fine. But if you don’t want to change the overall feel of a song, you have to be careful about making radical changes to the tempo, changes that go beyond minor rushing and dragging. You might inadvertently change the meter.</p>

<p>On the other hand, maybe you do want to change the feel of a tune. Maybe it sounds too mechanical or march-like. Reducing the BPM could help you achieve a more soulful sound by enabling you to switch from, say, simple quadruple meter to combined quadruple meter, embedding a skipple pulse on every beat.</p>

<p>Radical tempo changes have noticeable effects because they reflect changes in the number of beats your brain can process per unit of time.</p>

<ul>
  <li>At slow tempos, your brain can track more individual beats and pulses than it can at fast tempos.</li>
  <li>At fast tempos, the beats start to blur until your brain finds it more comfortable to convert, for example, three-beat pulses into two-beat pulses. Or four-pulse measures into two-pulse measures.</li>
</ul>

<p>Try counting to eight out loud in two seconds. It’s easy. Now try counting to 16 in two seconds. It’s a lot harder unless you kind of slur through all the even numbers.</p>

<p>Change of meter as a direct result of tempo change often happens automatically. You don’t even have to change the musical arrangement.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you play a song at a certain tempo in compound quadruple meter:</p>

<p>Four Tempo Ranges In Terms of Human LOCOMOTION</p>

<p>You might find it helpful to think of the tempo ranges in terms of the pace of human locomotion. Something like this:</p>

<p>60 BPM ±30 ”Strolling” Tempo (Slow) 120 BPM ±30 ”Walking” Tempo (Moderate) 180 BPM ±30 ”Jogging” Tempo (Lively) 240 BPM ±30 ”Running” Tempo (Fast) ​60 BPM ±30 ”Strolling” Tempo (Slow) 120 BPM ±30 ”Walking” Tempo (Moderate) 180 BPM ±30 ”Jogging” Tempo (Lively) 240 BPM ±30 ”Running” Tempo (Fast) ​</p>

<p>Table 59 below lists the BPMs of some classic recordings. It’s likely the great majority were recorded without a click track. So, if you try to sync a digital metronome to most of these recordings, you’ll find that the BPM value tends to vary a beat or three during the course of the recording. Small variations of this nature always occur. Most listeners don’t even notice them. They certainly don’t signify inadequate musicianship.</p>

<p>Far more songs have BPM values of between about 110 and 140 than above or below this range.</p>

<p>This is another opportunity for you to differentiate your own songs. Write a lot of comparatively fast tunes and comparatively slow ones. They’ll stand out from the mass of 110-to-140-BPM songs everybody writes by default. Just as songs in combined meter stand out from the mass of songs in simple meter.</p>

<p>One thing about singing fast tunes vs slow ones: slow tunes are less forgiving because note durations are longer. Pitchy (off-key) singing stands out. If you have</p>

<p>great vocal chops, you’ll shine when you sing at a slow tempo-provided the song’s a good one. But if you’re vocally challenged, a slow-tempo effort might make your audience flee.</p>

<h1 id="slow-down--and-youll-spend-more">SLOW DOWN … AND YOU’LL SPEND MORE</h1>

<p>If you own a restaurant or supermarket, you can induce your customers to spend more money by playing slow-tempo background music. Slow music leads to lingering and higher spending. Customers lock into the tempo of the music they hear. So if the music’s fast, they move faster and get out of the store or restaurant sooner than if the music’s slow.</p>

<p>In the restaurant industry, the type of music matters, too. A study in Britain revealed that classical background music, with its connotations of affluence and sophistication, led to the highest spending, compared with popular music or no music.</p>

<h3 id="774">7.7.4</h3>

<p>How to Make Slow Tempo SeEm Fast (and VICE-VERSA)</p>

<p>Suppose you’re playing a tune at 120 BPM, with a natural accent every second beat. If you then have one or more rhythm instruments accent every beat instead of every second beat, the tempo will seem faster. This is called diminution. More diminution in Chapter 9.</p>

<h2 id="o-fast-music-driver-get-a-horse">O FAST-MUSIC DRIVER: GET A HORSE</h2>

<p>Researchers studying the effects of music listening on driving behaviour found that the faster and louder the music in the car, the greater the probability the driver will crash. Twice as likely as a “slow-music” driver. “Fast-music” drivers tend to run red lights more often … no doubt a contributing factor to their crash rates. And it doesn’t matter what kind of music-rock, jazz, classical, dance. If the tempo of the music you’re listening to while driving is fast, you’re more likely to crash.</p>

<p>So, there you have it, up-tempo drivers. Heed the advice of Sadie and Ellie Sue: get a horse.</p>

<h3 id="781">7.8.1</h3>

<h2 id="how-to-tell-meter-from-rhythm">How TO Tell Meter From Rhythm</h2>

<p>Rhythm cannot be divorced from melody. You can think of rhythm as the soul of melody.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, rhythm is the aspect of music that has to do with the distribution of beats and pulses through time. But for purposes of this discussion, it’s more useful to think of rhythm in a narrower, more specific sense. A rhythm pattern is an irregular succession of tones. You perceive rhythm as being superimposed on a steady, regular beat, which remains steady and regular even as beats group into pulses and pulses into meter.</p>

<p>In performance, normally once you establish the meter and tempo of a song in the song’s 4 - or 8 -bar intro, the meter and tempo do not change throughout the song-unless, of course, changes in meter or tempo are part of the song’s structure.</p>

<p>Rhythm, by contrast, consists of irregular patterns of sound-irregular, at least, over the duration of a bar or two or three or four, after which rhythm patterns usually repeat. Since the internal irregularity of rhythm patterns contrasts with the regularity of meter, rhythm patterns grab listener attention.</p>

<p>For example, consider the most famous guitar riff in rock, Keith Richards’ riff that opens “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction” and repeats throughout most of the song. Try this: tap out a regular beat with your hand or foot while humming the 10 notes of the riff. What you tap is meter, what you hum is rhythm. The guitar riff is an irregular pattern that repeats every two bars. Its irregularity contrasts with the uniformity of the meter, which is simple quadruple:</p>

<p>(The above diagram does not convey the fact that the notes of the riff sustain from note to note, including that big gap between the fifth and sixth notes, across the bar line for the next beat and a half. But … you get the picture.)</p>

<p>In the above example, rhythm is as much melodic as it is temporal. The term melodic rhythm refers to the temporal pattern of a melody, such as the pattern of the</p>

<p>“Satisfaction” guitar riff. Melodic rhythm applies to any melody, whether sung or played on an instrument.</p>

<p>The combination of drums, bass, and so-called “rhythm” guitar is called the rhythm section. A better term would be the “meter section” or maybe “pulse section.”</p>

<p>A single instrument hardly ever plays only meter or only rhythm. Drummers and bass players typically play distinctive rhythm patterns while simultaneously emphasizing and maintaining the steady train of metrical pulses. By the same token, vocalists and solo instrumentalists repeat melodies in patterns that recur every bar or every few bars-patterns that become metrically predictable as a song unfolds in time, thus reinforcing the meter.</p>

<h2 id="how-simple-ratios-work-in-marking-the-flow-of-time-the-law-of-simple-multiples-or-fractions-of-the-underlying-beat">How Simple Ratios Work in Marking the Flow of Time: The Law of Simple Multiples OR FRACTIONS OF THE UNDERLYING BEAT</h2>

<p>No matter how irregular a rhythm pattern may seem, your brain’s evolved obsession with making sense of beat sequences ensures that the rhythm pattern cannot violate the following law. It’s The Law of Simple Multiples or Fractions of the Underlying Beat:</p>

<p>The durations of all the different beats in any rhythm pattern will always manifest as simple multiples or fractions of the underlying beat, regardless of rhythmic complexity or tempo.</p>

<p>For example, consider the “Satisfaction” guitar riff. It has 10 notes, distributed over eight beats as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Note 1</li>
  <li>Note 211/2211/2 beats ( 3:23:2 ratio with the underlying beat)</li>
  <li>Notes 3 and 41/241/2 beat each (each at 1:2 ratio; total of 1 full beat)</li>
  <li>Note 5</li>
  <li>Notes 6 - 101/2101/2 beat each (each at 1:2 ratio; total of 21/221/2 beats)</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of the riff’s 10 notes is a simple multiple or fraction of the underlying beat. The same law applies to gaps, called rests, within and between rhythm patterns. In music, every note of every duration has a corresponding rest of the same duration.</p>

<p>Usually, when you sit down to write a song, among the first decisions you make, whether consciously or unconsciously, have to do with meter and tempo. Most of the time, you just launch into the tune in “default” meter (simple quadruple) at “default” tempo ( 110 to 140 BPM ).</p>

<p>You can play or sing any ol’ irregular rhythm patterns you want, without the slightest concern about whether or not they’ll correspond to the meter. The Law of Simple Multiples or Fractions of the Underlying Beat ensures that beat, pulse, and meter will automatically emerge from whatever rhythms you concoct.</p>

<p>To paraphrase E. O. Wilson, beat holds rhythm on a leash. And, paradoxically, vice-versa.</p>

<p>You can play funk, polka, reggae, Bo Diddley, it doesn’t matter. The individual notes that make up the rhythms you play or sing manifest as simple multiples or fractions of an underlying beat that emerges automatically, along with pulse and meter.</p>

<p>How does this happen?</p>

<h1 id="783">7.8.3</h1>
<p>How Accents “Automatically”<br />
Communicate Beat, Pulse, and Meter</p>

<p>Some of the notes that make up a rhythm pattern are accented in one or more ways that communicate the beat:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Metrical position accent: Strong vs weak metrical position</li>
  <li>Duration (agogic) accent: Long vs short duration</li>
  <li>Pitch accent: High vs low pitch</li>
  <li>Dynamic accent: Loud vs soft volume level</li>
</ul>

<p>Often, two or more accent types coincide on a single note. For example, the fifth note of the “Satisfaction”riff is both the highest note of the riff (pitch accent) and the longest note (duration accent). As well, the fifth note begins on a metrically weak beat but sustains to incorporate the first note of the second bar (metrical position accent).</p>

<p>You’ll find it virtually impossible to deliberately counteract or hinder the steady procession of metrical pulses that emerges as you play rhythm patterns. You do not have to think about whether or not you’ve played enough beats with the correct accents to create uniform measures. Your brain automatically and correctly adds up the fractional and multiple beat durations and rest durations of the notes of your rhythm patterns and forges them into neat, uniform measures. Your playing and singing communicate those measures to your audience, without any conscious effort on your part.</p>

<p>That’s why, when you play a song, you don’t need to make an effort to play every beat of every measure. In fact, if you were to do that, your listeners would pelt you with cooked cabbages. Or, worse, Brussels sprouts. Because, if you were to merely</p>

<p>play every beat, your playing would sound exactly like a metronome-unforgivably boring.</p>

<p>Instead, you play and sing a variety of irregular rhythm patterns. Your listeners’ brains automatically perceive that the individual long and short notes that make up the irregular patterns are actually simple multiples or fractions of a regular underlying beat. They tap their toes to the underlying beat while enjoying (you hope) the contrasting metrical irregularity of the phrases you sing. The very difference between the regularity of the beat and the irregularity of your rhythmic phrasing is what makes the music you play and sing rhythmically interesting. The closer your rhythm patterns match the meter, the more boring your audience finds them.</p>

<p>Before you know it, your irregular rhythm patterns have neatly and automatically grouped themselves into four successive measures, each with exactly the same number of beats (usually four, sometimes three), grouped into regular pulses.</p>

<p>You continue with another four measures. Now you’ve played eight measures, each with exactly the same number of pulses-even though you aren’t paying the slightest attention to pulses and measures. Certainly not counting them.</p>

<p>Moreover, it doesn’t matter whether you’re playing a single instrument all by yourself in a little room, or you’re playing in a band with a drummer, bass player, and rhythm guitar player. Even the craziest, most complicated rhythm patterns of vocalists and solo players automatically conform to the metrical structure, the steady underlying beat. You simply cannot stop yourself from communicating the beat, pulse, and meter unless you make a conscious effort to do so. That’s the power of the Law of Simple Multiples or Fractions of the Underlying Beat.</p>

<p>Since you don’t have to think about beat, pulse, and meter, you have amazing freedom to get as creative with melodic rhythm as you see fit.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-ostinato-your-close-personal-friend">UNDERSTANDING OSTINATO, YOUR CLOSE PERSONAL FRIEND</h2>

<p>A few pages ago, you learned a specific definition of a rhythm pattern: “an irregular succession of tones.” An ostinato is a rhythm pattern that has several important properties:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s short. An ostinato usually lasts only a bar or two. Often only a fraction of a bar.</li>
  <li>It repeats. Ostinato is Italian for “obstinate” or “stubborn.” An ostinato is an irregular rhythm pattern that stubbornly recurs, many times in succession</li>
</ul>

<p>(unlike other rhythm patterns in a song). Sometimes an ostinato persists for the full duration of the song.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It can be purely rhythmic, or rhythmic and melodic, or rhythmic and harmonic. For example, Keith Richards’ “Satisfaction” riff is an ostinato that is both melodic and rhythmic. However, if you clap the 10 -note pattern of the “Satisfaction”guitar riff (and repeat the pattern continuously), your clapping constitutes a purely rhythmic ostinato. An ostinato can also take the form of a repeated sequence of chords, such as the famous “Blue Moon” progression: I - VIm - IIm - V7.</li>
</ul>

<p>A song can have several ostinatos going on at the same time-for example, a Latin percussion pattern, a distinctive bass rhythm pattern, and a three-note trumpet figure repeating every two bars.</p>

<p>Listen to any great recording of a popular song and you’ll usually be able to pick out several ostinatos, instrumental and vocal. Some appear only in verses, some only in choruses, some only in the middle eight, and some throughout the song. For examples of vocal ostinatos, have a listen to “laundry list” songs, such as John Lennon’s “God” or Bob Dylan’s “A Hard Rain’s A-gonna Fall.”</p>

<p>Ostinatos that continue for the duration of a song are sometimes called “grooves.” Some ostinatos, associated with specific performers, genres, sub-genres, or styles of dance, have names such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Boogie woogie</li>
  <li>Bo Diddley beat</li>
  <li>Memphis beat</li>
  <li>Jazz waltz</li>
  <li>Louie Louie beat</li>
  <li>Tango</li>
  <li>Bolero</li>
  <li>Polka</li>
  <li>Samba</li>
  <li>Bossa Nova</li>
</ul>

<p>But most ostinatos do not have names. They’re just short vocal or instrumental patterns that repeat successively:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Background singers repeating “baybah, baybah” throughout a verse or chorus</li>
  <li>Travis-style guitar finger-picking accompanying a folk or country vocal</li>
  <li>The drum part in Ravel’s “Bolero” (a spectacular ostinato)</li>
</ul>

<p>Think of the ostinato as the lowest form of rhythm, as opposed to meter. Ostinatos serve a vital purpose: they provide structure to a song.</p>

<p>SUPERIMPOSED OSTINATOS IN HIP-HOP AND DANCE/ELECTRONICA</p>

<p>If you aspire to be a hip-hop or dance music producer, you need to become a master of ostinato, the rhythmic mainstay of beatmakers. Hip-hop and dance tracks usually contain multiple ostinatos, superimposed in accordance with the good ol’ Law of Simple Multiples or Fractions of the Underlying Beat. Some of the ostinatos change from section to section, some remain throughout the track.</p>

<p>In Figure 131 below, for example, A, B, C, and D represent completely different superimposed ostinatos (i.e., each is an irregular rhythm pattern, not just a pulse) in various percussion, synth, and bass parts.</p>

<p>In dance music, the meter is simple quadruple. But in hip-hop, as discussed in Section 7.6.3, the meter is often combined. Each “underlying beat” is a skpple pulse, and therefore has built-in swing. That’s why hip-hop beatmakers have to be careful to keep superimposed ostinatos irregular but simple. Otherwise, the overall rhythm could become cluttered and confusing-not inviting of entrainment.</p>

<p>Table 62 below shows how the ostinato fits into the larger structural picture.</p>

<h2 id="keep-your-bass-player-and-fire-your-drummer-if-you-have-to-choose">Keep Your Bass Player and Fire Your DRUMMER (IF YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE)</h2>

<p>Drums and bass both communicate meter, while adding rhythmic interest (usually via ostinato).</p>

<p>Q: If you’re lost in Jaurez in the rain and you have to fire either your drummer or your bassist to remain financially solvent, which player would it be wiser to axe?</p>

<p>A: The drummer. (Or, like Sarah McLachlan, just marry him.) The White Stripes notwithstanding, bass is not only a mainstay of meter, it also contributes hugely to tonality and harmony by stepping through the important notes-chord roots, thirds, and fifths.</p>

<p>Although melody forms the skyline and gets the glory, bass provides the foundation of the overall sound.</p>

<h1 id="drummer-daisuke-inoue-inventor-of-karaoke">DRUMMER DAISUKE INOUE, INVENTOR OF KARAOKE</h1>

<p>Next time you’re having a few at the Wrong Ranch Saloon on karaoke night and decide to stagger up to the stage to see if you can make the crowd forget Sadie and Ellie Sue’s eccentric duet rendition of ‘Love will Tear Us Apart,’ spare a thought for the man who made it all possible. That good-natured Japanese sometime drummer, Daisuke Inoue.</p>

<p>Born in Osaka in 1940, Inoue played drums badly in cover bands in the 1960s for businessmen who liked to sing songs with live accompaniment. in 1970, at the request of a client, he made a tape of his band playing songs without vocals and packaged it with a microphone and amplifier: the first karaoke machine. (Karaoke literally means ‘empty orchestra.’) The idea caught on, and he and his friends made a bunch of the machines and leased them to bars around town.</p>

<p>Alas, Inoue neglected to patent his invention, which soon became all the rage in Asia, and in time swept the world. Today, karaoke is a multi-billion-dollar industry.</p>

<p>For his efforts, Inoue received the Ig Nobel peace prize in 2004, an incredible honour for a drummer.</p>

<h2 id="one-big-difference-big-beat">One Big Difference: Big Beat</h2>

<p>Many people think that, in the days of Bach and Beethoven and Mozart, most people listened to the music of Bach and Beethoven and Mozart. Not true. The mass of people never heard of ‘em. The masses did not live in cities and did not attend concerts of so-called “serious” music. They lived on farms and in small villages. They played and sang their own folk songs, and danced to their own home-made music.</p>

<p>Unlike “classical” music, most popular and indigenous music was, and still is, comprised of words set to music. Humans prefer music with lyrics.</p>

<p>Also, as discussed in Chapter 2, most “classical” music, in addition to being purely instrumental, emphasizes melody and harmony and de-emphasizes beat, pulse, and meter. Beat-impoverished music does not invite entrainment. A symphony orchestra may have 50 or 60 or 70 players, but only one is a percussionist (sometimes two), and the percussionist does not even play throughout a typical symphonic piece.</p>

<p>No wonder, then, that if you were to chart the relative popularity of “serious,” formally-composed music against “popular” music over centuries gone by and even into the future, the comparisons would probably look something like Figure 132:</p>

<p>If you cannot play a musical instrument well … take heart! There’s a special place for the likes of you.</p>

<p>Yes, it’s The Really Terrible Orchestra, affectionately known as the RTO. They even have a CD on the market. Curiously, it’s hard to find. RTO concerts always sell out for the same reason Florence Foster Jenkins’ recitals always sold out.</p>

<p>For more information on the RTO, gallop on over to their modest website:</p>

<h2 id="other-big-differences-improvisation-syncopation-and-polyrhythm">OTHER BIG DIFFERENCES: IMPROVISATION, SYNCOPATION, AND POLYRHYTHM</h2>

<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>

<p>In fifteen seconds, the difference between composition and improvisation is that in composition, you have all the time you want to decide what you want to say in fifteen seconds, while in improvisation, you have fifteen seconds. -STEVE LACY defining improvisation in 15 seconds</p>

<p>As discussed in Chapter 2 in the section on jazz, improvisation all but disappeared from European and North American classical and popular music until, in the early 20th 20th  Century, jazz came along and resurrected it. Why did it nearly vanish in the first place?</p>

<p>In his book on improvisation, Derek Bailey offers this explanation:</p>

<p>The petrifying effect of European classical music on those things it touches-jazz, many folk musics, and all popular musics have suffered grievously in their contact with it-made the prospect of finding improvisation there pretty remote. Formal, precious, self-absorbed, pompous, harbouring rigid conventions and carefully preserved hierarchical distinctions; obsessed with its geniuses and timeless masterpieces, shunning the accidental and the unexpected: the world of classical music provides an unlikely setting for improvisation.</p>

<p>He then goes on to note that in early European classical music, improvisation actually did play a major role. But over time, with the ascent of the conductor as the “chief of police” of the orchestra, improvisation in classical music declined rapidly until it disappeared altogether.</p>

<p>Improvisation almost always implies syncopation in melodic rhythm: accenting beats that normally don’t get accented, foiling the brain’s prediction machinery and heightening rhythmic interest. While syncopation is most radical in jazz, syncopated rhythms are also found in most good popular songs.</p>

<p>A simple example: the fifth note of the “Satisfaction” riff is rhythmically important because it’s the longest note (duration accent) and highest-pitched note of the riff (pitch accent). But it falls on the metrically weak position between the fourth beat of the first bar and first beat of the second bar. This results in rhythmic dissonance, or syncopation. The fifth note is more interesting and gets more attention than it would have gotten had it fallen predictably on the metrically-strong first beat of the second bar, a half-beat later.</p>

<h1 id="cross-rhythm">Cross Rhythm</h1>

<p>A common way of creating syncopated rhythmic interest is to use a type of ostinato called cross rhythm. In cross rhythm, the strong accents of the rhythm pattern fall on weak accents (or between accents) of the meter, resulting in a pronounced syncopated effect.

  <li>Get your right foot tapping at a steady moderate tempo.</li>
  <li>As you tap your foot, count 1-2-1-2. Continue for several bars.</li>
  <li>Start tapping your right thigh with your right hand in unison with your right foot, still counting. Continue for several measures. It’s dead easy with foot and hand tapping in regular steady sync. Like this:</li>

  <li>Now, with your right hand, tap three times (counting aloud) in the same time interval that your right foot taps twice, every second measure. Note that the 3hand-tap durations are equal and distributed over two foot-taps, not one. So it’s not as easy as it seems. The hand-taps are a little faster than the foot taps, but not a lot faster.</li>

<p>You may find it easier if you don’t have to do both parts yourself. For instance, you could get a metronome to do the 1-2-1-2 part, while you tap the 1-2-3-1-2-3 part.</p>

<p>You can hear examples of #4 and #5 above on The Doors’ original seven-minute recording of “Light My Fire,” beginning at around the 5:15 mark, near the end of the long instrumental bridge.</p>

<p>The left hemisphere of your brain, which controls your right foot and right hand, is dominant for temporal sequencing. So, if you’re right-handed, you will probably find it more difficult to do the above experiment with your left foot and left hand, especially as the tempo increases. (Try it!)</p>

<p>In general, contrasting duple and triple pulses played simultaneously result in polyrhythm. Between bar lines, the pulse accents conflict. Every measure or two, the accents sync up.</p>

<p>Rappers commonly employ polyrhythm in their rhythmic delivery. If you can find a way to work a bit of polyrhythm into your songwriting, by all means, do it.</p>

<p>In general, when the synchrony of beat, pulse, and meter get disturbed, emotional response increases with the intensity and frequency of the disturbance. Table 64</p>

<p>below summarizes how you can optimize unity and variety in your songwriting by making astute choices with respect to pulse, meter, tempo, and rhythm.</p>

<h2 id="the-wundt-curve-of-unity-and-variety">The Wundt Curve of Unity and Variety</h2>

<p>Your songwriting and recording will benefit greatly if you get into the habit of using the Wundt curve to evaluate unity and variety inherent in each element of your songs-harmony, meter and rhythm, form, melody, lyrics, recorded performance, musical arrangement. And the song as a whole. Especially the song as a whole.</p>

<p>The Wundt curve (named for the German psychologist Wilhelm Wundt, widely regarded as the founder of experimental psychology) looks like an inverted “U.” In a musical context, the Wundt curve shows how the relative complexity of a musical stimulus affects your listeners’ perception of pleasure, their “hedonic response.”</p>

<p>As the novelty and complexity of the song or song element (the stimulus) increases, listeners get more interested in what they’re hearing. And they experience more pleasure (the response).</p>

<p>But only up to a point. After that, as you continue to increase musical or lyrical novelty or complexity, hedonic response decreases because listeners’ brains simply can’t take it all in and decode it (Figure 133). Human memory does not work like silicon chip memory.</p>

alt="img-141.jpeg" /> (The citizens of the city of St. Louis, Missouri, were so impressed with the Wundt curve that, in 1964, they commissioned the construction of an enormous monument to the Wundt curve- 630 feet high!-and called it the “Gateway Arch” because it sounds better than “Wundt Arch.” To see what it looks like, go to the official website, <a href="http://www.gatewayarch.com/">www.GatewayArch.com</a>. Click on “Photographs” in the left-hand column.)</p>

<p>Most of the time, songs that fail (i.e., do not move audiences emotionally) have too many elements that cluster too far to the right on the Wundt curve. Too many extended chords (as opposed to simple triads and dominant sevenths). Too many melodic phrases that go on too long with too few breaks. Too many unrepeated words in the lyric. Too many instruments playing simultaneously in the performance of the song (live or recorded). Just too much going on in general. Repeat: human memory does not work like silicon chip memory.</p>

<p>Great songwriters have an understanding of the degree of novelty each element of a song can stand without ruining the song as a whole. Many things happen simultaneously as a song unfolds: chord changes, meter, rhythm, melody, lyrics, instrumental performance, vocal performance. So it’s better to practise restraint with</p>

<p>respect to the individual elements. Restraint tends to work better than excess. After all, the audience hears the combined effect of all the elements. So if you go overboard with each of the individual elements, you end up with incomprehensible, confusing mush.</p>

<p>Lennon and McCartney were the supreme masters at knowing where to draw the line musically and lyrically with each element of each song. Most listeners perceive the combined effect of most Lennon-McCartney songs as occupying the top of the Wundt curve: maximally interesting (variety), yet maximally accessible (unity)-the observation deck at the top of the Gateway Arch. You can never go wrong studying the Lennon-McCartney catalogue.</p>

<p>You can turn up the novelty in one element if you tone it down in another. For example, Pink Floyd’s “Money” has highly irregular meter, corresponding to a position on the right-hand side on the Wundt curve. But the arrangement of voices and instruments is such that the chunking of pulses is obvious and easy to follow, corresponding to a position on the left-hand side of the curve. So the listener finds it easy to follow the pulses and at the same time takes pleasure in the novelty of the unusual meter. Metrically, the listener experiences the top of the Wundt curve.</p>

<p>As you create your own songs, use the Wundt curve as a mental check at every stage. Table 64 above and related tables on optimizing unity and variety near the ends of Chapters 6 through 10 will help you make informed decisions about how far to go with each element.</p>

<p>Whatever you do, ignore rubbish about the need to “challenge the listener” with “challenging music” and “challenging lyrics.” Songwriters who adopt this mindset end up stocking challenging shelves at Wal-Mart because nobody wants to listen to inhuman songs that communicate nothing emotionally, except irritation.</p>
