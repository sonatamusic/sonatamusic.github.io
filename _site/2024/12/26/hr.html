<h2 id="piquing-the-polarized">PIQUING THE POLARIZED</h2>

<p>Chapter 1 addresses these five basic questions about music:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="/2025/01/08/what.html">ЧТО</a> музыка вообще такое</li>
  <li><a href="/2025/01/09/who.html">КТО</a> придумал музыку</li>
  <li><a href="/2025/01/10/where.html">ГДЕ</a> возникла музыка</li>
  <li><a href="/2025/01/11/when.html">КОГДА</a> пояявилась музыка</li>
  <li><a href="/2025/01/12/why.html">ПОЧЕМУ/ЗАЧЕМ</a> вообще существует музыка</li>
</ol>

<p>The other question, “HOW does one go about creating music worth listening to?” takes nine chapters to answer-Chapters 3 through 11, the main part of the book.</p>

<p>Tackling the five “Ws” of the phenomenon of music necessitates delving into Darwinian natural selection and sexual selection. If you have a strong religious faith,</p>

<p>you may find bits of Chapter 1 offensive because of all the evolution stuff. On the other hand, if you have a strong atheistic belief, Chapter 1 may offend you, too, because it does not advocate for atheism.</p>

<p>If you already know all about natural selection and sexual selection and brain modularity, then Chapter 1 might simply bore you. If so, why not grab a bag of chips and ride on ahead to Chapter 2, which discusses the rise of the Western popular music industry and its various genres. Or Chapters 3 through 11, the sections on how to create memorable, emotionally powerful music and lyrics.</p>
